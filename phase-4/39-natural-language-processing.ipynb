    "#### Lexicon Normalization \n",
    "Aside from stopwords, a different type of noise can arise in NLP. For example, collect, collection, collected, and collecting are all similar words. Using stemming and lemmatization would reduce all variations of the same word to the root version of all its derivations. \n",

    "###### Stemming \n",
    "Stemming allows us to remove different variations of the same word. For example, collect, collection and collecting will all be reduced to the same single word collect.\n",
    "- Stemming is the process of reducing inflection in words to their root forms, such as mapping a group of words to the same stem even if the stem itself is not a valid word in the Language.\n",
    " \n",
    "- Stems are created by removing the suffixes or prefixes used with a word.\n",

I gave 4 for this movie and it may be too much. Characters are so over exaggerated than they can ever be in real life and some pretty unexplainable stuff happens 'storywise', not in good way. Because of the style this film has been filmed you get bored after 30 minutes (too many special effects: slow motions and camera shakes and fast forwards). It's always good that movie uses music to make the story go smooth but there's too many tracks in this one. In the first hour there is almost 50/50 dialogs and musics\"\n",
    "review_2 = \"Devil Hunter gained notoriety for the fact that it's on the DPP 'Video Nasty' list, but it really needn't have been. Many films on the list where there for God (and DPP) only known reasons, and while this isn't the tamest of the bunch; there isn't a lot here that warrants banning...which is a shame because I never would have sat through it where it not for the fact that it's on 'the shopping list'. The plot actually gives the film a decent base - or at least more of a decent base than most cannibal films - and it follows an actress who is kidnapped and dragged off into the Amazon jungle. A hunter is then hired to find her, but along the way he has to brave the natives, lead by a man who calls himself 'The Devil' (hence the title). The film basically just plods along for eighty five minutes and there really aren't many scenes of interest. It's a real shame that Jess Franco ended up making films like this because the man clearly has talent; as seen by films such as The Diabolical Dr Z, Venus in Furs, Faceless and She Kills in Ecstasy, but unfortunately his good films are just gems amongst heaps of crap and Devil Hunter is very much a part of the crap. I saw this film purely because I want to be able to say I've seen everything on the DPP's list (just two more to go!), and I'm guessing that's why most other people who have seen it, saw it. But if you're not on the lookout for Nasties; there really is no reason to bother with this one.\"\n",
    "review_3 = \"`Stanley and Iris' is a heart warming film about two people who find each other and help one another overcome their problems in life. Stanley's life is difficult, because he never learned to read or write. Iris is a widower with two teenage children working in a bakery where she meets Stanley. She decides to teach Stanley how to read at her home in her spare time. Over time they become romantically involved. After Stanley learns to read, he goes off to a good job in Chicago, only to return to Iris and ask her to marry him.<br /><br />It's a really good film without nudity, violence, or profanity, that which is rare in today's films. A good film all round. <br /><br />\"\n",
    "review_4 = \"This may not be a memorable classic, but it is a touching romance with an important theme that stresses the importance of literacy in modern society and the devastating career and life consequences for any unfortunate individual lacking this vital skill.<br /><br />The story revolves around Iris, a widow who becomes acquainted with a fellow employee at her factory job, an illiterate cafeteria worker named Stanley. Iris discovers that Stanley is unable to read, and after he loses his job, she gives him reading lessons at home in her kitchen. Of course, as you might predict, the two, although initially wary of involvement, develop feelings for each other...<br /><br />Jane Fonda competently plays Iris, a woman with problems of her own, coping with a job lacking prospects, two teenage children (one pregnant), an unemployed sister and her abusive husband. However, Robert DeNiro is of course brilliant in his endearing portrayal of the intelligent and resourceful, but illiterate, Stanley, bringing a dignity to the role that commands respect. They aren't your typical charming young yuppie couple, as generally depicted in on screen romances, but an ordinary working class, middle aged pair with pretty down to earth struggles.<br /><br />I won't give the ending away, but it's a lovely, heartwarming romance and a personal look into the troubling issue of adult illiteracy, albeit from the perspective of a fictional character.\"\n",

I gave 4 for this movie and it may be too much. Characters are so over exaggerated than they can ever be in real life and some pretty unexplainable stuff happens 'storywise', not in good way. Because of the style this film has been filmed you get bored after 30 minutes (too many special effects: slow motions and camera shakes and fast forwards). It's always good that movie uses music to make the story go smooth but there's too many tracks in this one. In the first hour there is almost 50/50 dialogs and musics\"\n",
    "review_2 = \"Devil Hunter gained notoriety for the fact that it's on the DPP 'Video Nasty' list, but it really needn't have been. Many films on the list where there for God (and DPP) only known reasons, and while this isn't the tamest of the bunch; there isn't a lot here that warrants banning...which is a shame because I never would have sat through it where it not for the fact that it's on 'the shopping list'. The plot actually gives the film a decent base - or at least more of a decent base than most cannibal films - and it follows an actress who is kidnapped and dragged off into the Amazon jungle. A hunter is then hired to find her, but along the way he has to brave the natives, lead by a man who calls himself 'The Devil' (hence the title). The film basically just plods along for eighty five minutes and there really aren't many scenes of interest. It's a real shame that Jess Franco ended up making films like this because the man clearly has talent; as seen by films such as The Diabolical Dr Z, Venus in Furs, Faceless and She Kills in Ecstasy, but unfortunately his good films are just gems amongst heaps of crap and Devil Hunter is very much a part of the crap. I saw this film purely because I want to be able to say I've seen everything on the DPP's list (just two more to go!), and I'm guessing that's why most other people who have seen it, saw it. But if you're not on the lookout for Nasties; there really is no reason to bother with this one.\"\n",
    "review_3 = \"`Stanley and Iris' is a heart warming film about two people who find each other and help one another overcome their problems in life. Stanley's life is difficult, because he never learned to read or write. Iris is a widower with two teenage children working in a bakery where she meets Stanley. She decides to teach Stanley how to read at her home in her spare time. Over time they become romantically involved. After Stanley learns to read, he goes off to a good job in Chicago, only to return to Iris and ask her to marry him.<br /><br />It's a really good film without nudity, violence, or profanity, that which is rare in today's films. A good film all round. <br /><br />\"\n",
    "review_4 = \"This may not be a memorable classic, but it is a touching romance with an important theme that stresses the importance of literacy in modern society and the devastating career and life consequences for any unfortunate individual lacking this vital skill.<br /><br />The story revolves around Iris, a widow who becomes acquainted with a fellow employee at her factory job, an illiterate cafeteria worker named Stanley. Iris discovers that Stanley is unable to read, and after he loses his job, she gives him reading lessons at home in her kitchen. Of course, as you might predict, the two, although initially wary of involvement, develop feelings for each other...<br /><br />Jane Fonda competently plays Iris, a woman with problems of her own, coping with a job lacking prospects, two teenage children (one pregnant), an unemployed sister and her abusive husband. However, Robert DeNiro is of course brilliant in his endearing portrayal of the intelligent and resourceful, but illiterate, Stanley, bringing a dignity to the role that commands respect. They aren't your typical charming young yuppie couple, as generally depicted in on screen romances, but an ordinary working class, middle aged pair with pretty down to earth struggles.<br /><br />I won't give the ending away, but it's a lovely, heartwarming romance and a personal look into the troubling issue of adult illiteracy, albeit from the perspective of a fictional character.\"\n",

I’d say we can handle maybe one or two more former members of Trump’s inner circle over the remainder of the year, but that’s it.

We’ll be playing ‘The Little Drummer Boy’ 24/7 until Christmas, and if people don’t like it, they can switch to a different station.” Boccia added that the station would continue it years-long practice of refusing to play “Silver Bells” due to the song being an obvious affront to Christ.',\n",

       " \"O socialism America Oprah Obama O'Rourke Ocasio Michelle Obama, Barack Obama, Oprah Winfrey, Beto O‘Rourke, Ocasio-Cortez, these are all darling of the socialist democrat party in America who all have something in common, the letter ‘o’. What is it about the letter ‘o’ that is so endearing to the socialist and their dream of turning America into a pseudo-communist socialist state resembling Venezuela? We asked Democrat party official Oona Menendez, the same question. “Why is the letter ‘o’ so important for Democrat politicians, especially regarding elections?” She replied quite succinctly: “Candidates have a greater success with the letter ‘o’ in their name because it breed familiarity. Like with an ‘o’ people immediately know they’re safe, they are guaranteed socialism or communism. We adopted the significance of ‘o’ after eight year of Barack Obama rule. He wa the first big ‘o’ which denoted ‘change’ and he brought in much socialist and Marxist change to America, which is sadly being eroded by the current president. ‘O’ also stand for the circle, inclusivity, globalism, and collectivism. The main reason though, a I mentioned before, is familiarity, because when a voter is about to tick the box on election day, all they have to look for is where the Os are. If you see an ‘o’ on the first or last name, that’s who you vote for — Democrat. It’s really a simple a that.” We asked her where ‘Hillary’ fit into this? “She doesn’t. Never has, never will.”\",\n",

       " 'Amedeo Modigliani (1884–1920) The ever present insanity of Big Brother Google and it puritanical push to meddle with every step the Daily Squib take is taking a toll on our patience. Showcasing a masterpiece from renowned painter Modigliani is now deemed a sexual perversion by internet monopoly Google who threatened to disable our ad on the front page. This sort of puritanical nonsense is possibly just another way of punishing the Squib on a constant basis but what is for certain, it is highly illogical and go against any artistic sensibility or reason. The Modigliani nude are world famous and displayed in art gallery worldwide, having said that, it is inconsistent with normal human behaviour to ban a nude painting of a woman because it is an artistic representation of the female form created by an artist. It boggles the mind the amount of censorship that is being doled out on a constant basis on our site, and we can only suppose we are being specifically targeted by Google to thwart every operation we do. We cannot joke, we cannot display art, we cannot write satire, we cannot do anything anymore without being censored by the humourless, anti-art, anti-satire, anti-creativity company called Google. This injustice, is of course not deemed a important by others, and the double standard reek of a witch hunt against satire site like ours who have a different opinion, and dare to speak freely. Whilst Google allows other site to display scene of torture, violence, paedophilia and perverted sexual content, we simply displayed a painting of a Modigliani nude painting and were summarily punished. There is a nefarious air about the level of censorship, that is certainly even more pervasive than wa witnessed under Soviet Russia’s era of discontent or any dystopian nightmare scenario dreamed up by George Orwell. As for Modigliani, what would he have said if his nude were deemed a offensive. Naturally he would have spat in the face of his accusers, and called them a few well chosen names, before leaving in pure disgust. Nu couché (We have not posted a picture of the painting because it is deemed sexually offensive by Google but it can be viewed on the Wikipedia link above) Known in English a Red Nude or Reclining Nude is a 1917 oil on canvas painting by the Italian artist Amedeo Modigliani. It is one of his most widely reproduced and exhibited paintings. The painting wa sold for a cool $170,405,000 at a Christie’s New York sale on 9 November 2015, a record for a Modigliani painting and placing it high among the most expensive painting ever sold. The purchaser wa the Chinese businessman Liu Yiqian. The painting is one of a famous series of nude that Modigliani painted in 1917 under the patronage of his Polish dealer Léopold Zborowski. It is believed to have been included in Modigliani’s first and only art show in 1917, at the Galerie Berthe Weill. Christie’s lot note for their November 2015 sale of the painting observed that this group of nude by Modigliani served to reaffirm and reinvigorate the nude a a subject of modernist art. All we can say in pure disgust is one day we hope the ghost of Modigliani haunt you Google, and the robotic soulless piece of detritus you have working for you censoring art and the Daily Squib.',\n",

We all still live in a surveillance society where every part of our life and info is dissected, analysed and stored in databases, we still live in a world where idiot run amuck in a state of perpetual outrage demanding le freedom and more censorship, we still live in a world where people believe in supernatural being that can rise from the dead, walk on water, and turn water into wine. C’mon it’s just another fucking year. You have just passed another year, and now have le time to live on earth, and what an earth this ha become, an overcrowded cesspool filled with garbage in the seas, plastic everywhere and pollution reaching every part of the once pure soil, now just a concrete mess clouded by fumes, cow farts, and mountain of human waste. It will certainly be another year in politics, and the lie will continue, a nothing changes, or will ever change. They only give you a few choice for a reason in an election, because both side are merely different part of the same coin. The controller always own both sides, and the reason for ‘elections’ in a ‘democratic’ society is to present a few well-selected fresh faces, otherwise people get tired and riot. The elite in 2019 will most probably be quivering in their boots, and if it get too bad, they will simply exit to New Zealand or wherever else they have prepared. One major weakness the elite always encounter is number — there are more of the Untermensch than them. The stock market, a place where there will be much terror will naturally keep on falling in 2019. Possibly a 40-60% correction is planned, and if you are holding stock now, you are sadly a fool with no sense whatsoever. In fact, you deserve every bit of what you get because you did not take your money out earlier at the artificially pumped top. We also have Ebola to look forward to in 2019 a it increase it hold on Africa, much to the chagrin of the West, who keep their open border system in place, there is no doubt this horrid virus will spread soon enough. Trump, is now looking to lose in 2020. The purge of supporting Trump voice on all social medium site ha been so effective that now there is only one voice — the socialist echo chamber. We will have more authoritarianism, we will have more outrage from the permanently outraged, we will have more censorship and the internet will be cleansed of life, of it soul, and in it place the control freak tech puritan will command over your every thought, they will dictate your every move, and they will tell you how to think and act…and if you don’t obey? Then they delete you from everything. Trump himself ha been a huge disappointment. Here is a guy who had big plans. He said he would go after the internet censor and he never did. He said he would limit the all encompassing power of the tech monopoly but he never did. He said he would build a wall but never did, he said he would do so many thing but he did not. He said he would dump Obamacare, but never did. Trump is now a man running scared, he is a man who ha obviously tried to do some thing but ha been thwarted at every point by the crazed socialist employing guerilla tactic to get what they want. What about Brexit? How will 2019 be for Britain’s supposed exit from the EU..pfffft? More of the same..No Brexit, no hope of Brexit and no one willing to stand up for democracy and the EU Referendum Leave voters. Because May is bolstered by the elite, she is nigh on impossible to get rid of. The May-bot’s battery will continue on serving her masters, until she completes her job, they then will take the battery out themselves — no one else can. All in all, 2019 will be another year where those in charge control every facet of our lives. Another miserable year of non-freedom and slavery ahead then. To all our readers..Happy New Year.',\n",

It doe not matter if she resigns just before the election a she ha promised to do, because she will have already committed the necessary damage. Theresa May ha vowed to stay on until her BRINO is pushed through parliament. This act will be the defining moment when the Tories will be abandoned. Already, the Americans have stated that May’s deal mean no massive trade deal with the US, thus leaving the UK with nothing. Already, Lord Haw Haw Hammond is again trying to thwart a Clean Brexit by withholding special fund for a No Deal Brexit. Something must be done right now.

The ANTIFA will not survive either, anti-gun democrat will perish, because they just can’t shoot straight even if they did have a gun. The Conservative American Patriot credo is shoot straight, finish the job, then move on to the next target. “Our divided nation now is hanging by a string.

       " 'Matthew 1:18-25 (the deed of the Christian God) 18 Now the birth of Jesus the Messiah took place in this way. When his mother Mary had been engaged to Joseph, but before they lived together, she wa found to be with child from the Holy Spirit. 19 Her husband Joseph, being a righteous man and unwilling to expose her to public disgrace, planned to dismiss her quietly. 20 But just when he had resolved to do this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary a your wife, for the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. 21 She will bear a son, and you are to name him Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.” 22 All this took place to fulfill what had been spoken by the Lord through the prophet: 23 “Look, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall name him Emmanuel,” which means, “God is with us.” 24 When Joseph awoke from sleep, he did a the angel of the Lord commanded him; he took her a his wife, 25 but had no marital relation with her until she had borne a son; and he named him Jesus. Biblical expert have been studying the fact about the virgin birth of Jesus, from different ancient texts, and have come to the conclusion that Mary wa sexually raped by the Holy Ghost i.e. God. “The poor girl wa still a virgin and she had no capacity to refuse the seed of God entering her vagina and womb. God had sexual intercourse with Mary one night and she felt violated by a being who did not care for her feeling but did the dirty deed anyway. Selfish God had sex with Mary because he thought she wa attractive and he had the power to rape her. “Within the generation we live in today, the #MeToo generation, God would be called a rapist for taking that poor girl and having sex with her without her consent. “It wa not only poor Mary who wa hard done by, but think of Joseph, he had not yet slept with his childhood sweetheart, when he wa cucked at the post by God. Luckily, Joseph took the whole sordid episode in his stride and went along with the violated Mary and her baby Jesus,” Episcopal Dean of St Albrights Christian Research Institute, Jonathan Rembrandt, revealed in a recent study. The Angel of the Lord who appeared after the rape, wa possibly a demon looking to have some fun with Mary according to theologians. “The demon who appeared to Mary looked like an angel, but wa actually a demon, one of God’s emissary who tried to justify the rape by saying it wa okay to be violated by God’s pulsating phallus. Our scripture reveal that God ha a large member that shoot out Holy Sperm into his fancies, and when he ejaculate the Spirit and the Holy Ghost shoot out with such force that the Holy semen light up in the darkness, sparkling like a thousand fireworks. What Mary would have felt a she wa impregnated without her consent wa possibly great confusion, coupled with pain a she wa pierced violently by the Holy spear of God. Thrusting, and thrusting until the great Holy climax.” The story of the nativity that ha been taught for many year is thus one of sordid rape by an almighty entity that had it way with a little virgin girl, abused her body to sow a supposed Son of God who could perform crazy miracle like walk on water and turn water into wine. “Rape should not be tolerated even if it is God who is committing it. This is a sign of the patriarchal society trying to make sexual assault okay because a God committed it. No, we say it is wrong that God raped a poor little virgin girl and then left without even saying a word to her. Does anyone think how alone and cold she must have felt, to be raped and abandoned in such a way?” #MeToo activist, Hilda Goldsberg, told a group of activist in a new YouTube video. The outrage at Mary’s rape by God is now spreading across the social medium sites, with the hashtags #GodRapedMary #MeTooMary #GodRapes. Divine Intervention? The Christian church ha been party to much rape in it history, however many Archbishops, and the Catholic Pope deny that God raped Mary. “Yes, he had sexual intercourse with Mary without her permission, but it wa for a very good reason. Without impregnating Mary, Jesus would never have existed, even though there is no factual proof he did exist. That is not rape, but divine Godly intervention and fairy tale told to the blindly believing mass over thousand of years. It is the same Christian theory used when a Catholic priest rape a 9-year-old boy, in the name of God,” the Pope said replying to the voice of outrage spreading across the internet. One Twitter person replied: “So it’s okay to rape a woman if you are a God and want to bring your dumbass son into this earth? Did Mary have a say in this? Her body wa violated by the Holy Ghost’s jism in her pussy. Can you even think for a second how sick that is?” The mass debate go on.',\n",
       " 'Throughout history, defeating nations/civilisations depended on undermining men and masculinity. Conquering nation requires a multi-tiered approach and targeting the society of any given nation divide it infrastructure and traditions. No doubt, the West celebrates it openness and progressive liberal tenet by pushing the trans queer paedophilia agenda onto their children, however by shifting society to the extreme homosexual angle, they are weakening society militarily. This is why Russia and China are utilising the Western feminist movement a well a the transexual/homosexual push to defeat the West from the inside. Masculinity is now seen a toxic in the West. Men are targeted daily by anti-male medium stories, advertisements, and education in schools. By targeting child to question their given gender/sexuality, and encouraging socialist leaning parent to push their child to change their gender, especially from male to female, is an effective method of ‘cutting the ball off’ Western society. Agencies are weaponising socialist celebration of the LGBT community to weaken the West from the inside. When war comes, there will only be a few real men to fight, the rest will not be compatible or able soldiers, this is the ultimate victory for the West’s opponents. Clandestine operation expert working for Russia are the one who are encouraging the #MeToo movement, because it destabilises Western society through the breakdown of family units. They encourage feminism and fund feminist activist through the backdoor because to not have a strong masculine West mean it is weak and ripe for conquest. These operative work through many subsidiary to encourage the Western male to think he is a woman, do the right thing, chop off your meat and two veg at a gender clinic and grow some hormone breasts. “They are disarming the West, seeding disharmony, confusion, and leaving Western men emasculated, castrated by feminism and socialist activist funded directly by the Kremlin and Chinese espionage experts. S-r-s is key to much of the operational activity but is untouchable,” a source revealed. Before any attack, one must prepare, these are the tenet of Sun Tzu, and this is what Russia/China are doing — preparing. Weakening the West by eradicating real men, if there are only weak emasculated men left, once the final push come through, there will be little or no resistance. Other way that China particularly is working on to weaken the West is through importation of drug like Fentanyl, an opiate 50-100 time stronger than heroin, that is decimating whole community in the United States. The vast pharmaceutical factory in China are working day and night churning out cheap highly addictive drug to be shipped to America, for a very good reason, disarming the nation from within. The West is being set up, and nobody but a few can see it. The Russians and Chinese want your son emasculated, they want your son to want to think he is a woman and have his ball chopped off, they want your son to be encouraged at nursery school to be taught in homosexuality by socialist teacher under a poster of a smiling Obama. The Western medium now is geared completely to denigrating men, to weaken masculinity and to encourage male child to be gender reassigned. Through socialism, Russia and China are working to defeat the West to such a point that in the future, they may just march in and be accepted without a single bullet being fired. When one look at the society of Russia and China, there is only strength. Homosexuality and feminism is not accepted, and neither is transgenderism. The onus is on engendering a strong masculine culture, where strength of the male character is valued, because when they are called up for war, they will fight, and not crumble unlike the weak Western male, after decade of targeted emasculation. When the attack comes, the emasculated Western former men will all huddle in their ‘safe spaces’. The masculine Russian and Chinese soldier will not feel pity or remorse a they plunge their bayonet deep into the simpering soy juiced chemically castrated manjinas huddled around yelping in fear and proclaiming their undying support of feminism. War is coming. It is inevitable because of dwindling finite global resource and increase in population in Third World developing nations. The West may have the technological military advantage however that may not be enough if there are not the number to operate with boot on the ground.',\n",

       " 'T he industry of online gambling is highly popular in the world and, specifically, in the UK. From April 2017 to March 2018, it ha made a revenue of ₤4.9 billion. British citizen are lucky enough to be eligible to gamble on licensed online platform almost without restrictions. Providers have to follow KYC/AML policy and customer have to meet the age requirements, but that’s the necessary limitations. Despite the loyal attitude, the main national authority (the United Kingdom Gambling Commission) focus on toughening the control over the industry. With the emergence of new technology like blockchain, a new approach to gambling is being actively discussed. A lot of bloggers, like Katie Wager, analyse the future of online casinos, considering possible legislative change and technical innovations. Let’s discover the situation, trying to see the future prospect of online betting in the UK. Some background The very first online casino wa developed and launched by Microgaming in 1994. A software provider CryptoLogic designed the security system and safe money transfer for this platform. The UK citizen were able to use all online casino before 2005, when the UKGC wa established and the first Gambling Act wa signed. In 2014, the new version of this law wa presented, forcing every operator, including offshore ones, to get British license in order to operate in the UK. The current state of affair Online casino are allowed in the United Kingdom if they have been licensed by the local Gambling Commission. British customer can hardly enjoy other operators, a payment system block money transfer to unlicensed platforms. Still, there are enough official website to choose from. The Gambling Act of 2005 and it amendment of 2014 are the main legal document which regulate both offline and online gambling. The UKGC monitor the activity of British and foreign casinos, ban or penalize violators, and propose new laws. The community is anxious a the Commission began to tighten restrictions. Recent and upcoming change Let’s see what change can be brought by the UKGC’s decision and what difference can technical progress make. Legal field The beginning of 2018 wa troubling. The Commission stated that it would fight unregulated gambling, a well a introduce new requirement for licensed casinos. The announced change were related to bonus and term and conditions, higher transparency of casino rules, and more information about expenses. According to BBC, the UKGC also consulted with the Remote Gambling Association (RGA) on two approaches: Enhancing self-exclusion systems. GAMSTOP is the official national platform which is going to include all online casino to allow gambler to control their experience. Additionally, the British may use GambleAware, which is an independent charity organization focused on popularizing responsible gambling. Regulating advertisements. In the cooperation with the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), the Commission ban ad which create a fake urgency and trivialize games. Also, the government want to impose extra fine on casino operator that don’t meet the ASA’s requirements. New rule discussed by the UKGC and the RGA may totally ban ad during live sport event and their translations, excluding horse races. Restrictions will affect online sportsbooks mostly, but casino should be aware a well. According to the information from iGaming Business, betting company still have to approve the decision. Moreover, online casino are under the fire. The Guardian state that in the late November 2018, the UK Gambling Commission penalized four gambling company because of the failing in anti-money laundering and poor protection from problem gambling. There were huge fine imposed on three company (Daub Alderney, Casumo, Videoslots), while the fourth one (CZ Holdings) wa forced to leave the UK market. At least six more operator are under investigation. Experts say that casino have to be attentive, a the UKGS is way stricter now than it wa a few year ago. It’s not enough to obtain a license but it’s also crucial to meet KYC/AML policy and help gambler that show addictive behaviour. Tech and innovation Considering these changes, the online gambling industry may move towards decentralization. It’s an extremely competitive sector where casino operator have to provide the best quality and safety to keep their customer loyal. Decentralized system can fulfill all the demand of modern user who want to be sure about security and transparency of their experience. Blockchain is the most promising innovation that is being implemented by casinos. Blockchain-powered platform are totally independent of government and payment systems. Cryptocurrencies are another great feature of blockchain. In refined Bitcoin casinos, gambler can avoid long expensive transfer with the involvement of third parties. Encryption used for performing crypto transaction is also an important measure of protection. The fate of online casino in the UK It should be clear that authority in the UK are going to make online gambling more regulated. Thousands of customer may be upset with this fact: higher fines, banned ads, and runaway operator damage the gambling ecosystem. Thus, new-age system should enliven the market with innovation like blockchain and crypto. Moreover, a Forbes notes, they can even expand to the land-based gambling facilities, bringing the industry to a new level.',\n",
       " 'There’s nothing worse for rich people who have to sometimes pas through area of a city or countryside only to be confronted with unsightly poor people going about their business or rioting in the streets. Seeing an opening in the high end luxury market, a tech company from Paris, France ha come up with digital eyewear that simply edits out undesirable and the Untermensch a well a ugly poverty ridden surroundings. “Why see slum when you can look across Lake Geneva?” is the catchy tagline for the digital glasses. “The user specifies what sort of people that the digital AI system will edit out, and through face and gait recognition a well a what type of clothes the person you are looking at is wearing, the system will simply erase them from your view so a not to add offence to your sensibilities. Whether it is the crack addled street scum, welfare recipients, ethnics, tramps, migrants, gypsy or working class people, you will never have to look upon them ever again,” Pierre Martineaux, startup CEO, for eFFACER revealed on Wednesday. The glass are so sophisticated that they even have sensitive smell sensor embedded on the frame, and can can detect a poor person from over 100 yards. “Poor people have a certain smell, and it’s certainly not Givenchy or Pierre Cardin. This is the first line of defence. Then the image of the person is run across an extensive database, and erased before the wearer notices. Our sophisticated database engine also recognises whether the image is a rich person dressing down, for example ‘shabby chic’ a la pop starlet and actors. These people are not erased from view, because they may be simply champagne socialist celebrity and such,” Martineaux added. The company is so confident of their product that they recently tested the glass at a Gilets Jaunes violent protest. “I approached the Champs Elysees and I could hear some faint activity, rocks, shouting and siren through my headphone but nothing bothersome. The glass however edited out every single person from the riot a they were successfully identified a poor people. All I could see wa the boulevard on a warm Parisian summer’s day. It wa truly amazing, because I had my headphone on a well and wa listening to some delightful adagio from Mozart, so the experience wa not unsettling at all,” project engineer, Eric Dugasse revealed. Unfortunately, he wa later hit on the head with a pavement stone during the exercise and now ha permanent brain damage. Despite small setbacks, the company still plan to go ahead with the first phase of production. The glass will not come cheap either, a they will only be accessible to the market they are aimed at — the super rich. They will retail at a yearly subscription price of 1.4 million euros. The reasoning behind the subscription model is that the tech is constantly updated, which work to the advantage of the wearer a well a funding further research into the product. “Why upset your day by seeing offensive thing like poor people and migrants? We are also designing a new machine learning system that not only edits out poor people and other undesirables, but replaces them with AI depiction of rich people a designated by the wearer. This is not only revolutionary, but will ensure that the rich are not tortured daily by the crass vulgar display of poverty that are so prevalent in this day and age.” Endorsements for the product have already come in from high, French President Emmanuel Macron ha ordered a pair, a ha EU President, Jean Claude Juncker. All member of the European Commission will be given complementary pair funded by EU taxpayer of course.',\n",

Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, ha already tabled the motion at an emergency parliamentary session shortly after Opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn wa called in to apologise. The word ‘stupid’ will however not be banned, because it is an adequate description of many who attend the House, and the word they speak could be easily described a ‘stupid’. “It is impossible in this day and age to have such a thing a a ‘stupid w*man’. All wom*n have IQs well above Albert Einstein and he wa a measly man not worthy of stupidity. I hereby declare that no w*man can be described a stupid. They are all very intelligent creature above the level of men. We can still say ‘stupid man’, that is perfectly acceptable because men are now classed a third rate citizens. Furthermore, with regard to Theresa May, I would like to reiterate the point that she is not a ‘stupid w*man’ but a ‘stupid cunt of the highest order'”, one member of the parliamentary committee in charge of stupidity in the House said before being heckled.\",\n",

       " 'The only way Theresa May can ever vindicate her previous inaction and misguided action, is through an orderly Clean Brexit or a it is labelled by the perpetually afraid — a No Deal Brexit. The government should therefore give business more clarity on the process of a managed Clean Brexit to allay their fears. The rest of the world ha been trading perfectly well under WTO rules, a doe Britain right now. The Project Fearmongers are a bunch of hysterical Remoaners who are only afraid that they will be cut off from their mother’s teat momentarily, i.e. mother Brussels, who give them their monthly stipend and backhanders. This is why the government must step up their preparation with extra budget available for all business in Britain, and tax reductions, a well a tax break taken from the £39 Billion which would otherwise have been thrown away into the EU black hole. Theresa May must present a positive view of a Clean Brexit, and all this Millennium Bug scaremongering must be stopped. Anna Soubry who ha threatened to resign would be another welcome effect of a Clean Brexit. The contemptuous witch should have been fired and thrown from the party in disgrace a long time ago anyway. The Clean Brexit should become central policy immediately, and it should be embraced a a wonderful opportunity to escape the EU cleanly. If Theresa May doe not adhere to this Clean Brexit then she should be removed and a real implementation of the Brexit must be conducted by a Brexiteer. This is the only opportunity for Britain to exit the EU with some dignity and Theresa May to vindicate herself.',\n",

What ha happened to this once great, proud nation to see the Prime Minister grovelling on her knee to Brussels bureaucrats? No dignity left “I felt some vomit coming up when I saw Theresa May with this desperate forlorn look on her face. She wa completely alone whilst the EU boss all looked at her with pity and derision. Her begging face wa out. I just wanted to go over to her and kick her in the shin really hard. It wa a disgusting, repulsive view of someone so profoundly weak that it brought on nausea. Thatcher would never have done this. She would have told the lot of them to ‘eff off!’,” a stunned British onlooker revealed. Is the PM stupid? Anyone with any logic would have known that her Brexit in Name Only would never be accepted by parliament because it go against every concept that wa voted for on June 23, 2016 at the EU Referendum. The blame ha to also lie with the idiot in charge of the Conservative party who put a Remainer in charge of Brexit. She did not have her heart in it, she exuded a negative vibe about the whole process, then tried to pas through a blatant capitulation to the EU through the backdoor. “I have no sympathy for that thing they call Theresa May. It is an automaton, a programmed robot that just keep knocking it head against a brick wall. Someone, or something need to take the fucking battery out of that thing because it’s making an almighty mockery of Britain,” another shocked observer revealed. The sight of Mrs May dragging the country through the dirt in such a pitiful manner is so sickening, one almost expects her to go to the EU Commission car park and start bukkake dogging session with the Brussels bureaucrat all queueing up to get serviced. For god’s sake woman…just resign, at least keep some dignity.',\n",

The data will go directly to our intelligence agency and will be utilised for future military operations. We do have some understanding about how the Chinese operate, however we need a more direct line, and thanks to Google, they stepped up,” one former member of the intelligence community revealed. The secretive Chinese have effectively cut off their communist nation from the rest of the world with regard to the internet, and this is why there ha to be a cleaner more agreeable method of information acquisition. Human right activist have recently voiced their concern about Google venturing into the Chinese market due to the brutal nature of the communist regime in dealing with those who are not accepted by the communist party ideology, however this is no concern to Google or intelligence agencies. They just see the people who are arrested and brutally tortured by the Chinese authority a collateral damage in a bigger game. The data acquired will be of huge interest especially when it come to the financial markets, global economics, and internal communist operations, a well a general information about the Chinese population a a whole. China ha been conducting blatant act of stealing classified information from the West for some time, so this time, Google will be doing the honour for the West. What is certain, is that the information which will be received from China with Operation Dragonfly will serve the West well. Another certainty, which ha now been confirmed a a definite is that Google is a defacto arm of the United States military intelligence cloaked in a civilian disguise, that is now flapping in the wind, uncovered for all to see.',\n",
       " 'Jean Claude Juncker wa emphatic that the current BRINO deal will never be renegotiated by Brussels. Theresa May faffing around sniffing bottom in Brussels will not achieve anything, and everyone know it. End of story. Therefore, every Conservative MP who vote to keep on Theresa May in the no confidence vote is effectively voting for a BRINO (Brexit In Name Only) deal which is the only thing May is committed to producing. There are some claim that May is saying she will step down before a general election, but only after she put through her BRINO deal. This is not acceptable to Leave voters, and is a blatant betrayal. Those MPs who thus vote to support May are not fit for purpose and have effectively betrayed every Leave voter who voted on June 23, 2016. Sir Bernard Jenkins, is definitely voting to oust May, and he ha been one of the only logical people speaking about this no confidence vote. In these circumstances, it should be known that many will feel extremely angry by Theresa May staying on just so she can push through her Brexit capitulation through parliament. The only way therefore to get rid of Theresa May, a the Conservatives are not fit to do so, is through a general election. If anyone ha any idea about how to force a general election please leave a comment below. We suspect it may have something to do with the DUP. They just need to withdraw their support for May’s government et voila..',\n",

Jeremy Corbyn’s party are keeping their finger crossed that the idiot who support May carry on doing so, because she is the passport to a Labour win at the next General election. “We know for sure that real Brexiteers will never vote Tory again if they keep Theresa May, and they will never support her BRINO deal. That’s vote lost for the Tories right there, 17.4 million odd. Labour will win the election because the Tories have effectively abandoned their grassroots voters,” a Labour election campaigner revealed today. After May’s roasting at the hand of Corbyn today at PMQ’s there is no doubt who ha the upper hand in parliament and it’s not Theresa May, who cannot even command any sort of relevant leadership. The Tories will be stupid to keep May, but Labour is counting on the stupidity and greed of the Conservatives, no doubt many have been bribed with promise of kushy seat in the House of Lords for May’s support. It doe not matter a jot whether May stay on and promise to go after Brexit, but before an election. The evil deed will have been done, the Brexit betrayal will have been committed, and for real Brexiteers this is enough. They will never vote Tory ever again. Every day, every hour, every second that May is kept on, Labour grows stronger, because they know now that THEY will have the vote at the next election and not the Tories led by an old boot, not fit for the knacker yard.',\n",

Forty eight letter of no confidence in dodgy Theresa May’s leadership have been placed with the 1922 Committee now, and the vote will hopefully be positive this evening. The PM’s nonsense Project Fear about delaying Brexit because of a new leader is absolute shit. What the PM is proposing is not a Brexit anyway, and will tie the UK with EU indefinitely. Anything is better than what she is proposing. Anything! Even if Brexit is delayed, at least it will be a real Brexit by a Brexiteer and not Theresa May’s BRINO. May ha said that she is now having to stay in London tonight and deal with a vote of no confidence (boo hoo) instead of negotiating with the EU, when Juncker ha definitely put down the clause that there is NO MORE NEGOTIATION. We need a leader who is positive about Britain’s exit from the EU, who belief in Brexit and doe not capitulate to Brussels at every opportunity. Once she is ousted, there ha to be a comprehensive clean-out of Remainers from the Cabinet and other position within power. This is the only way we will have Brexit, and there is no other way. The DS questioned the efficacy of having Remainers in charge of Brexit in 2016, and we knew then that it would never work. Thank the god of parliament and democracy that MPs are finally waking up to what the Daily Squib knew all along. Lord Haw Haw Hammond a the Chancellor of the Exchequer ha actively thwarted Brexit at every turn. There ha to be a change before Brexit can be realised properly, and if there is no change, then the problem will persist on and on until the Conservative party is completely decimated, and the nation is stuck with a Brexit deal which is not Brexit but an indefinite imprisonment to Brussels. We need action NOW more than ever to oust Theresa May who ha completely squandered her position and betrayed the British people. May is a festering pustule bubbling on the flaming arse of Beelzebub and need to be lanced immediately for the good of the country and parliament. Kick Theresa May and Philip Hammond into the sewer where they belong. If Theresa May is not thrown out, no Leave voter will ever vote Conservative again.',\n",

Then after five minute she call back cancelling her mass debate so we cancel everything. Two minute later she call and say she will have a mass debate with herself but filmed by u to be broadcast after the watershed,” an exhausted BBC executive revealed today. One of the PM’s aides, John Sommers, wa indignant about the whole affair. It’s a sticky problem “I just told her, come on, pull your finger out. You’re already knuckle deep in it. You have to have this mass debate otherwise people won’t take you seriously anymore. Trying to get the PM to make a decision is like rubbing a forty day old pollock until all the fish juice squirt out all over the carpet, imagine the smell of it.” After much wrangling, it ha been officially confirmed Theresa May will have her mass debate on telly, this Saturday. She will be mass debating with herself and trying to convince herself that her Brexit In Name Only bad deal is what people want. “The PM firmly belief in repetition.

       " 'Art depicting the female form is now banned at the new puritanical Tumblr Western civilisation is often proud of it freedom of speech and lack of censorship. In the past two decades, considerable result have been achieved in the fight for human rights, especially regarding LGBT member and women. However, it seems within the last several year the once easy-going West ha reverted back to the puritanical Middle Ages, with new censorious Soviet-style restriction appearing thus silencing the voice of the minority and adult in general. Tumblr is a place where people create blogs, find friends, and share everything one could even think of. Discussions of LGBT representation in media, explicit fan fiction and fan-art, sharing of nude picture — Tumblr allowed the exploration of one’s sexuality. It wa common to see post like “small breast are absolutely valid” or “check wellhello com review here and let’s meet”, with people eliminating such concept a body shaming and sex work/dating site negativity. Now, though, everything ha sadly changed. Tumblr’s New Policy Tumblr ha around 450 million blogs. As of December 17, the following rule become active. · No explicit and graphic content, including photos, gifs, and fan-art; · Especially no sex-related content; · Especially no ‘female-presenting nipples’. Needless to say, such news shocked every single user of the once liberty driven site. The last category ha become particularly horrific yet hilarious, with people exchanging pic ten time more actively, letting Tumblr staff guess which nipple could be recognized a female. Apparently, Tumblr officially recognizes male nipple a le sexy than those of females, but what about transgenders or people with breast scar who want to discus their stories? Tumblr claim that banning explicit content is to safeguard “children”, which is strange indeed since child are not supposed to be on Tumblr in the first place. So, how doe Tumblr intend to achieve it new policy? Tumblr’s Actual New Policy As of now, Tumblr ha managed to do the following: · Flagged every second non-explicit post related to LGBT, including text posts, all of which are supposed to be allowed; · Flagged work of art and sculpture with and without nudity; · Flagged bread; · Flagged it own post with a new policy announcement. Hysterical laughter is the only reaction Tumblr user are now experiencing. There is much speculation discussing the fact that Tumblr wa kicked off Apple and want to return there, that it want to secure the support of family-friendly organizations, etc. Which is the truth? No one knows. However, it is undoubtedly an act of censorship that target LGBT member and woman in particular. Tumblr’s new anti-sex policy is proving to be anti-LGBT and anti-female, and million of users, including minority and sex workers, are risking losing their safe harbor. In an attempt to eliminate healthy sexual self-expression, Tumblr even accidentally banned itself. It would have been funny if it wasn’t so disastrous, especially considering the century we live in.',\n",

You not only have risk of saying the wrong thing by accident and being #MeToo pilloried, or having a woman accuse you of sexual misconduct, or the added risk for the business with woman becoming pregnant adding on huge cost like maternity leave. The list is too long to mention here, but we just don’t hire them anymore. It’s a simple a that,” one CEO at a top trading firm in Wall Street revealed. Even talking to a woman at work is now risky because of the #MeToo era, anything a man say can be construed a sexist, offensive or demeaning. “We have one who work on our floor. We just nod at her or grunt a hello and walk past. You just can’t say anything else because of the lawsuit and Twitter,” a scared male employee revealed. The risk limiting is also now extending to the White House, where Vice President Mike Pence recently revealed that he avoids dining with woman other than his wife. “The golden rule from now on is never speak to a female colleague at work, avoid them at all costs. If you have to speak to a woman and it is necessary for the job, you must have at least four witness present, and all the door open, even if it is meant to be a private matter. The best way to avoid all of the hassle is not hiring women, and we are adopting this rule a number one.

       " 'L ast year, gambling operator in the UK spent just under 1.8 bn euro on marketing, with nearly half of the amount covering internet-based advertising and a mere 15% buying TV commercials. The trend is obvious: marketing expenditure is skyrocketing. In fact, according to a report by strategic consultancy Regulus Partners titled Gambling Advertising and Marketing Spend, it rose by 56% from 2014 to 2017. Today, there are numerous online gambling provider operating in the UK. For more information on the most popular ones, check out the fastest payout online casinos. Online promotion of such operator us direct, social medium and affiliate marketing methods. The former includes banner and paid search. Other advertising channel are television, sponsorship, and offline channels, such a print medium and billboards. The Breakdown Online marketing account for 80% of the total gambling marketing expenditure, with direct method amounting to almost half (48%) of it. While direct internet marketing doubled over the three-year period, social medium advertising more than tripled – rising from £42m in 2014 to £149m three year later. Affiliate marketing, which includes tipsters, website and publication that generate new business for a commission, wa the slowest, climbing from £282m to £301m, which is 20% of the overall marketing spend. As a lion’s share of marketing budget is now spent online, television advertising is lagging behind, despite the growth from £155m to £234m. The amount spent on sponsorship were still relatively moderate despite their doubling: advertising on football shirts, horse racing, and other event totaled £60m in 2017. It is important to note that a detailed marketing cost breakdown is commercially confidential, it is impossible to obtain definitive figures. The consultancy used audited account of the largest listed operators, a well a figure for offshore and private companies. The estimates, therefore, are sufficiently credible. Most importantly, they demonstrate the relative scope of online marketing. The Consequences The mentioned figure raise serious ethical issues. The Gambling Commission ha recently reported that a much a 59% of child aged 11-16 have been exposed to the ad on social networks. For television commercials, the proportion is even greater – 66%. According to Marc Etches, CEO of GambleAware, a leading UK charity, child following gambling operator on social medium are three time more likely to spend money on gambling. “Compared to other potentially harmful activities, the rate of gambling in the past week among young people is higher than the rate of drinking alcohol, smoking cigarette and taking illegal drugs”. This data point to the urgent need to perceive gambling a a threat to child and a public health issue. Social network and website must recognize their moral obligation to protect the youngest and the most susceptible ones. It is thus imperative to increase public awareness of the potential danger posed by the activity.',\n",

Europe need a tougher approach on immigration in order to curb the growing threat of right-wing populists, Hillary Clinton said, calling on EU leader to show their electorate that they can no longer “provide refuge and support.” “I think Europe need to get a handle on migration because that is what lit the flame,” Clinton said in an interview with the Guardian published Thursday. Reading a quote from the 2011 Daily Squib article entitled “How Long Before the EU Concentration Camp Chimneys Start Churning Smoke Again?” confirms Clinton’s diagnosis in 2018. We saw the warning signs, before anyone else did. Even in the UK, there are increasing report of racially charged assault and outburst by seemingly ‘normal white people’, but these are mere symptom of the Hegelian dialectic where the problem of increased immigration wa allowed and encouraged to happen by successive government for a very good reason — to create discord, disharmony, hatred and fear amongst the indigenous populations. An immigration open door policy wa allowed to occur so a to create a problem of overcrowding in urban areas; destruction of indigenous culture, valuable resource being used up, intolerance and racism to flourish. “First you create the problem, then you wait for the people to cry out, then you move in with a solution that enslaves the people even further than they already are,” Gunther Mauser, a German politician told Die Welt newspaper. We would go a far a saying that the engineered migration problem is not only part of the Coudenhove-Kalergi plan, but also a ploy to bring out Europe’s ultimate inherent racism. The socialist of Europe are just a racist a the other side, however they veil their racism better. Socialists need someone to point their finger at, so they can rally the troop during elections, it give them vigour and impetus. We witnessed this recently during the American midterm elections, where the American socialist and communist effectively censored and dehumanised their opposition and won many seat in Congress from the Republicans. Anyone who care about their own home, security or family is demonised and labelled a “racist” or a “populist” by the socialists.

Along with the youth vote, the extra number will get Corbyn into Number 10, Downing Street and Theresa May out. “It’s now the only way to get rid of her. Jeremy Corbyn is the only way, because the Tories can’t do it, despite her blatantly taunting Brexiteers with her lies. I’m not a socialist or a communist like Corbyn but I will vote for him, a he is the only eurosceptic left who can actually do something,” another former Tory voter revealed. Thanks to Theresa May's Brexit Betrayal Will You Now Vote For Jeremy Corbyn? Yes No View Results Jeremy Corbyn’s main reason for leaving the EU will be to bolster a firm communist state in Britain without the interference of the EU, and it ideals. “Corbyn see the EU a a meddling money sucker. It would be better to leave the EU completely so that Britain could keep it money to spend on socialist issues, the NHS, welfare, and education. Also, Corbyn will need tonne of money for the many nationalisation he ha planned. This will take a lot of capital, especially the rail networks, nationalising utilities, and building million of new council house across the UK,” Labour’s chief spokesman, Mike Oxlong, told the New Statesman. No one will vote conservative for another thirty to forty year after this debacle, and quite rightly so. Britain will thus be resigned to it fate a a pseudo-communist island replete with comrade in arm marching up and down Red Trafalgar Square. It say a lot that many Brexiteers will move towards Jeremy Corbyn, who is the antithesis of everything they believe in, however there is an old saying, an enemy of my enemy is my friend. Corbyn is now the friend, and Theresa May the enemy. Viva La Revolucion!\",\n",
       " 'There’s something about the future that scare the shit out of people a lot, maybe it’s simply the thought of the unknown that affect u with such fear. What possible delight await u in the technological future when we are already living in a world full of burgeoning robotic tech, AI, VR, and sex robots? Forward to 2071, and you find that people have not changed much, they still have the same old foible a we do, except with holovision. One assumes reading through the page that this is some sort of contraption that transmits moving hologram visuals in your room, so that mean the age of the television ha been left in the dust, along with radio and telegrams. By 2075 we have the introduction of teledildonics, and this is not describing a floppy thingie protruding from Mark Zuckerberg’s forehead but a contraption that can excite a future date, with a bit of mutual masturbation, why not? It’s all very Black Mirror but without the enclosed claustrophobic stories, these glimpse into the future are more diary like, snippet of scenarios. Let u say an Adrian Mole of 2097. Quite astutely, the author see the future rise of China, and we can be assured this will certainly become a reality with the Chinese Armada skirmishing with the Royal Navy across the high seas, or conducting bombing run on Bognor Regis every other Tuesday. In 2079, John Lewis is still in Oxford Street. This came a a great fucking relief, because one can’t imagine that particular London shopping district without John Lewis. Let u hope that Hamleys is still around too, albeit selling hoverboards for the kiddies. In turn, this is a great piece of literature whizzing from one place to another, and giving the reader little insight into the possible future, some comedic, some obviously horrific in a satirical sense. Not sure if the Singularity happens at all in the duration of time in the book, but the worst part seems to be the realisation that Celebrity Big Brother still exists in 2094. Isn’t all out nuclear devastation from Russia and China preferable to CBB still being around in the future? One can only imagine. People still play cricket in 2100, and probably still munch on cucumber sandwich during the break in play. This wa refreshing to read like a good cuppa. Anti-ageing treatment on the NHS are obligatory by 2128? Surely that will bankrupt the already aching NHS 2.0? Well, the government minister do debate the question, and thankfully come to their answer. Things get very interesting by 2157, especially amongst some of the Plutocrats, who are rather keen on the Ancient Egyptian civilisation. In 2060 mohawk-haired government adviser stalk the hall of Number 10 Downing Street, by that time, Tarzan Heseltine is a bag of bone deep in the ground somewhere, no doubt cursing someone who ha outdone him in the hair department. This book will certainly have you turning the page to see what happens next, isn’t that the job of a good novelist? Guy Portman no doubt seems to have fulfilled the desired effect on the reader, a you really have to turn the next page to see what wonder await, a compendium of technological prowess amongst the backdrop of human stupidity. The miniscule details, the jumping in from one language to another, and the mixing of ancient with modern add duality to an intelligent meal of a read. Well worth the purchase. Plonk it into your collection, and you will not be disappointed by this satirical tome from an indulgent innovative author. http://guyportman.com/ Purchase your copy now: Goodreads Amazon US Amazon UK Kobo UK Barnes & Noble',\n",
       " 'All the people wanted when they voted for Brexit wa to get out of the EU, and it institutions. Alas, since the EU referendum Brexit ha become more of a distant mirage, and unattainable dream simply because of the establishment putting obstacle in the way of leaving the EU, and the EU putting obstacle in the way a well. Any decision now regarding Brexit is meticulously broken down and voted out, and the sad thing is, if it come to the ideal Brexit, i.e. a Clean Brexit, that too will be voted down by the Remoaners. Against Brexit is the PM, the majority of the Remoaner Cabinet, handpicked by Remoaner PM Theresa May, the Treasury headed by Remoaner Lord Haw Haw Hammond, the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, a Canadian, and 95% of the House of Lords, a well a most of the so-called Conservative party hierarchy. Other group outside of parliament are the Soros Open Society, who fund people like Gina Miller to thwart Brexit in the High Court at any possible time, and other business people who are all on the EU gravy train and are fighting for their expense accounts. The medium is now mostly anti-Brexit, with even the Daily Mail siding with Remoaners and Brussels, this is possibly due to the exit of Paul Dacre, and the instatement of Remoaner Editor Geordie Greig. The BBC, which received £5 million just before the EU referendum from the EU is naturally pro-EU, and the CBI where Theresa May spoke the other day on the benefit of her BRINO deal is completely pro-EU a it receives million in EU money every year. As for the civil service, they are all completely pro-EU, and they control everything from behind the scenes, a la Olly Robbins. Suffice to say, the likelihood of a Brexit occurring anytime soon is about zero, and the far flung future is no better, the promise will drag on and on for year to come until everyone is so bored of it all they just elect to stay in the EU. Ultimately, this is the plan the EU and controller in government hope for. They want people to be so jaded by the whole bureaucratic affair that they say fuck it, and leave Britain in the EU. The whole sordid Brexit affair is extremely tiresome and sickening, because it brings to light that there is little or no democracy in Britain left. We are ultimately chained now to a corrupt system of government, and the EU’s totalitarian pseudo-communist diktats permanently and there is nothing anyone can do about it. Will the UK Ever Leave the EU? Yes No View Results',\n",

       " 'S ome people love the rush they get from watching horror films, while others completely hate it and can’t understand why anyone would choose to watch something with the intention of scaring themselves! Even though watching a horror movie the viewer know it is isn’t real, the best horror film are still able to leave you on the edge of your seat, ready to scream, but how are they able to have this effect? When watching a film usually the motor region of the brain are temporarily shut down, but in the case of many horror film the stimulus are so strong that it can overcome the inhibition to the motor system. The viewer then automatically jump or screams, a an automatic reaction designed to both protect u and warn others of danger. So much so that this actually happens before we even process what ha actually caused the fear. Horror film have been scaring viewer for more than a century, but it is only recently that neuroscience ha been able to be used to explain the reaction in the brain whilst watching a horror. Many different element are used within horror film with the purpose of frightening the viewer. The fear of death, which for most is the ultimate fear is often used, both in reality and psychologically. So that, the majority of horror audience will see at least one character reach their death. This is heightened even further, the more vile and evil the character is, like Gollum in The Hobbit franchise. The dark is often a childhood fear of many and is used within horror film to incite fear, by making the viewer wonder what is hiding or lurking in the shadow and ready to jump out. The best movie of this genre always contain element of suspense within them. Suspense involves the creation of anticipation that something bad is about to occur, but not knowing when. Some of the most shocking scene within horror film will create a mass of suspension, which will then end in something happening on the screen that will really shock the viewer, for example one of the main character getting killed, usually in some gruesome manner. Music is also used often to create anticipation and fear within horror movie and it can be used to create mood and elicit emotions. It help to amplify the feeling of shock and suspense within the viewer. Currently, horror devotee tend to agree that it is the Japanese who have discovered the right formula when it come to horror. This breed of horror film ha become really popular worldwide, but why are they so scary? Japanese horror movie really tend to focus on the psychological and suspense aspect within horror and will often heavily feature paranormal activity and also theme of exorcism, shamanism and possession. Some historical element of Kaidan, which is Japanese folklore is also often found within these films, many of them containing story of ghosts. It is clear to see that the element of Japanese horror are now finding their way over to the Western movie making world, by looking at film such a Paranormal Activity, which feature many of the same fear inducing trait that are familiar within Japanese horror. Therefore, we can see that many factor are utilised in the making of any horror film. The scariest and more often than not, the most successful movies, will find the perfect combination to keep audience in a state of constant fear and anxiety. This mental state is, believe it or not, exactly what audience are looking for and no doubt they will demand even more a time go on.',\n",

The amount and level of crime ha increased to such a level, that it wa ridiculous to suppose that police officer would attend crime in progress armed with nothing other than a puny truncheon and a pair of handcuffs. “Criminals these day carry an assortment of weapon from machete to AK-47s. You would get a policeman arriving at a crime scene, and he would be faced with thug running at him armed to the teeth while he get his little truncheon out and is tasked in taking down these criminals.

This is why our police will now be trained and armed in firearms,” a member of the policy team announced on Tuesday. What kind of firearm will the police now be trained and armed with? Each squad car will be equipped with an assortment of weapon including pump action shotguns, automatic weapon and tasers. All police will routinely be equipped with handgun and tasers whilst on patrol. “The level of crime is at such a level at the moment that our rule of engagement will be upgraded to shoot to kill. Our officer will also be protected from prosecution and most case will be accepted by the court a just proportionate action,” police spokesman, Andy Grenville, added. Recent polling ha shown that arming all police officer in Britain ha received a positive response with 85% approval rating.',\n",

TM: I am firmly committed to conducting the Brexit the people voted for, to take the UK out of the custom union, to control migration, to take the UK out of the Common Agricultural Policy, to take the UK out of the EU fishery policy and to take back control. DS: How can we get out of the custom union when there is a clause tying the UK to the EU permanently? Even your attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, warned you and the cabinet that this will be nigh on impossible to get out of, and even if the UK try to get out of it, it will take decade of lawyer working day and night at huge cost to the country. Not only that, you have conceded to pay the EU £39 billion for the pleasure of imprisonment and nothing else to show for it.

There were strong contender in each category and it wa always hard to choose one clear winner.” The new Responsibility Grand Prix for cause-related work went to “Price On Our Lives” from McCann Worldgroup in New York. The campaign allowed the student of America to protest against gun violence with a potent symbol: the price of their life a calculated by the amount of money the NRA donates to politicians, divided by the total number of students. The price tag amounted to little more than a dollar. Commenting on the win – and it Network of the Year prize – Rob Reilly, Global Creative Chairman, McCann Worldgroup, said, “Winning award is never the motivation, but rather, the by-product of doing the right thing for our client’s business. A big shout out to all of the MWG employee for always going for it, never giving up and making our brand partner wildly successful.” The Alternative Grand Prix, also a new prize, went to Publicis Italy and Diesel for a campaign that struck back against counterfeit fashion. Diesel created it own rip-off brand, “DEISEL”, and sold it in a shabby New York pop-up store during fashion week, before revealing that, yes, the clothes really were authentic – only the label wa wrong.

It used digital technology to recreate the speech John F. Kennedy would have given at the Dallas Trade Mart had he not been killed by an assassin’s bullet on November 22 1963.

Our first-ever civic identity system celebrates the diverse community while supporting and funding local creativity.” The Film Grand Prix wa won by Shiseido in-house for it quirky and poetic film “The Party Bus”, which combine animation, special effect and drama to tell a contemporary fairy tale. The 3D animation required close to 2000 stop motion shots. Shiseido creative director Masato Kosukegawa said: “I would like to thank Shou Yanagisawa, the director, and all the artist who worked with us, for their precise and inspired craft. ‘The Party Bus’ wa made to expand Shiseido’s reach to young people. We thought a lot about what we could do with makeup in this confused and divided world. In the end we arrived at the concept that makeup can be courageous, and that doing your makeup your own way brings self-confidence. This led u to touch on the topic of LGBT. In Japanese culture there is a strong conservative tendency, and story of LGBT are not commonly told yet. I think this film wa probably the first work by a major Japanese company to address LGBT in an advertisement.” Humour Category In the humour category, the Daily Squib’s favourite choice won the gold award, “Smart House” by entrant TRY, which displayed a hilarious satire on modern technology and it good/bad points. Another highlight wa the short but straight to the point ad “Shit in Space” suffice to say, there is something quite endearing about Norwegian humour and the creatives, producer at TRY agency in Norway.

The bit that really stick in the memory is the moment Eddie is in his jail cell singing Roxanne by the Police. This wa truly a wonderful cinematic and comedic scene. Nolte play a hard edged cop who enlists Murphy, a convict, to find a killer in le than 48 hours, or it’s jail time for Reggie. At the time, it wa a typical cliche black and white buddy movie, with the usual love and hate politics. Great film. Watch it if you ever missed it or were not born then.',\n",

No Deal Better Than Bad Deal You would certainly not think it from the Theresa May crew, who shrivel and kowtow to every Brussels belch. Who have constrained Britain and left it a whimpering bitch on the end of a leash. What did those men and woman die for in two world wars? It certainly wa not to be a subservient nation unable to make it own laws, unable to make it own trade deals, and unable to GET SOME FUCKING BOLLOCKS! We voted on June 23, 2016 in a democratic referendum to leave the Customs Union, leave the ECJ, leave the single market, and ultimately leave the EU — COMPLETELY! No half measures, no half foot in half out, none of that. The EU referendum result wa promised that it would be solidly binding and respected by parliament, and not meddled with. This promise wa of course made because the Remain side wa projected to win. When the result wa Leave, this wa obviously a different story and democracy flew out of the window. It seems there is no belief anymore in Britain, a land that ha much illustrious historic value, and ha been the bastion of adversity for thousand of years.

       " 'The technique the organiser of the migrant caravan will utilise to offset any military presence at the U.S. border will be to push the woman and child to the front, almost a a human shield, and to also display them to the world’s press who will be filming them. This method is utilised a a mean to shame the military, because they will be facing off to thousand of woman and children. This will also engender feeling of sadness amongst viewer and pity. The Mexican authority have repeatedly promised the migrant caravan people homes, benefits, schooling and safety, but none of the participant of the caravan have taken up the offer, even though many are claiming they are pursuing safety and asylum. They instead only talk about going to America. The organiser of the migrant caravan, are funded by many organisations, mostly socialist and communist, inadvertently funded by US taxpayer through shell charity organisations, and those linked to George Soros. In Guatemala, 11 Cuban national were detained, and many in the caravan are from far flung spot like Bangladesh, Congo and other Asian countries. It is a certainty that the migrant caravan wa planned over a year ago. This can be ascertained by the immense logistical operation, where food and rest stop along the route have all been meticulously laid out. Transport, and even payment to the participant of the caravan to continue their journey, some paid over $1,000 each for the trek by leftist groups. These poor people are effectively pawn of the leftist group who are manipulating them purely a a political agenda to undermine Donald Trump and America. This despicable act is a human tragedy and the organisation who have been implicit in organising this should have their US affiliate shut down by the Trump organisation and their fund seized. One cannot be sure of the response by the Trump administration when the migrant caravan hit the border, but if he back down he will be viewed a weak, if he act aggressively, then he will cause outrage amongst the leftist and communist within the United States. This is a very fine tightrope the president now find himself on. What will he do to get out of this calamity foisted on him and the country? How will all of this end? Could this topple Trump and his bid for 2020 reelection? Break out the popcorn and Schlitz and keep watching.',\n",
       " 'Time is running out, according to a global think tank, Strategic Universal Coalition Kraft, who determine that the acceleration of military might in Russia and China is outclassing anything that is happening in the West. “Russia recently unveiled a hypersonic ‘glider’ called Avangard, active under the Red Banner Missile Division, which is based in the south Urals. This terrifying weapon travel at 20 at time the speed of sound, is invulnerable to any air defences, and can strike a target anywhere on Earth ‘like a meteorite’, according to Vladimir Putin. “Russia’s ‘Satan II’ missile can carry up to 24 Avangards, which mean one fully-loaded nuke would have enough firepower to wipe out all the major city in the UK in one fell swoop. “China is developing a satellite system that can spot submarine at a depth of 500 metre which would render most fleet of Western nuclear submarine redundant and traceable. “Project Guanlan, meaning “watching the big waves”, wa officially launched in May at the Pilot National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology in Qingdao, Shandong. Song Xiaoquan, a researcher involved in the project, said if the team can develop the satellite a planned, it will make the upper layer of the sea “more or le transparent”. “The device is designed to generate high-power laser beam pulse in different colours, or frequencies, that allow sensitive receiver to pick up more information from various depths. Those laser beam can scan an area a wide a 100km, or concentrate on one spot just 1km wide. It will be used in conjunction with a microwave radar, also mounted on the satellite, to better identify targets. Although the radar cannot penetrate water, it can measure the surface movement with extremely high accuracy – so when a moving submarine creates small disturbance on the surface, the radar will tell the satellite where to throw the laser beam. “These are just a few example of a myriad of programme that have already been developed and are being implemented a well a programme in current development threatening the UK, and it NATO allies. “While other nation are spending on military hardware and upgrading their systems, the UK is falling by the side. The Ministry of Defence face a £15 billion shortfall in it budget for the next ten years, and is barely functioning a of right now. “The National Audit Office said that the MoD’s equipment plan – used to fund military hardware including combat aircraft and submarine – “remains unaffordable”, with the department itself forecasting a £7bn gap between now and 2028. “The situation is deteriorating to such a level that the MoD is currently considering whether to pause a raft of big project under the Modernising Defence Programme launched by minister earlier this year. “This disgraceful negligence by current and past government put the UK in considerable risk not only now, but in the future. If it doe not remedy these gap in funding, and increase spending immediately, Britain will be a sitting duck in any future conflict. “Not only should the government increase military spending by at least 60%, it must also implement a national program for all citizen of compulsory military service, healthy male 17 to 21 year old will serve in the armed force for 18 months. Compulsory conscription during peace time is a necessary preparation for future conflict coming soon. “The UK, must also expand it military preparation and increase cooperation with it allies, a they will be needed to bolster our defence when the conflict begins. “The UK must increase it army of hackers, because the conflict will most probably start with a massive cyber attack, which will seek to shut down Britain’s infrastructure, power, water, and transport. GCHQ must receive an increase of funding that will enable it to counteract an immense coordinated cyber attack. “If nothing is done now, it will be too late when the conflict commences.

The setting is the magnificent KIT Royal Tropical Institute, one of the city’s most remarkable buildings. Taking part in a series of exclusive round table conversation are ABN Amro, KPN, Nuon, Philips and PWC. The agency side is represented by BETC, Cheil, DDB, Superheroes, We Are Social and Wieden + Kennedy. They are joined by journalist from title such a Adweek, Adformatie, and Werben & Verkaufen. The industry is embodied by opinion leader from the EASA (European Advertising Standards Alliance), the IAB (Internet Advertising Bureau), the DDA (Dutch Digital Agencies) and the VEA (the association of Dutch communication consultants). Issues such a gender equality, sexuality, diversity, political extremism and climate change are impossible to ignore yet fraught with risk for communicators. When doe purpose-driven advertising becoming “cause washing”? Is it still possible to create controversial or even non-politically correct campaigns? Our thought on this matter is that political correctness ha come to such a level of censorship now that it is nigh on impossible to create anything edgy or humourous without offending someone who stir up a stink and then get you canned. Within the advertising world, it is now a serious no no to offend, because to some people everything is now offensive, and there are massive client budget on the line. This is a symptom of year of social programming of soviet-style group think, which ha leached out onto the mainstream media, and the advertising world. The medium will no doubt report on the event’s key findings. Students from the New School Amsterdam will also be present at the event, which is backed by partner Adobe, Euronews, Screenvision and the EASA. Meanwhile, there are still place available for the Epica Awards ceremony itself, from 7pm on November 14, when the Royal Tropical Institute will become the stage for a celebration of the world’s best creative work, a voted by the unique press jury of the Editors’ and Publishers’ International Creative Awards.

       " 'A t the end of the 2014 Premier League season, Manchester City topped the division, with Liverpool and Chelsea just behind, Spurs and Arsenal fought it out for fourth place and Manchester United struggled, finishing outside the Champions League spots. Sound familiar? Today in the Premier League, City sit on top, with the other five club placed in the same position outlined above. Similar narrative can be told for the top league in Spain, Germany, France and Italy. Frankly, it can feel a bit like watching the same actor in movie all over again. Sure, someone like Leicester City, who shocked the world in 2016 with their unlikely title victory, can have a ‘guest star’ role, but those seem to be fleeting and increasingly rare. Unpredictability doe not always equate to excitement, a sometimes unpredictability point to a lack of quality. However, the two do overlap, and one of the best league to see it happen is in the EFL Championship. Premier League money lift relegated club The Championship is in a unique position of Europe’s lower leagues. Many club are propped up by the largess of the Premier League, receiving parachute payment over four year after relegation from the top flight. For example, last season Hull City, Sunderland and Middlesbrough each received £40 million from the Premier League a a result of relegation in the 2016/17 season. In Deloitte’s ranking of football clubs, current Championship side West Brom and Stoke City have bigger operating revenue than top European club like Marseille, Lazio and several club competing in the Champions League. Of course, the Championship doe not have the quality of the Premier League, nor doe it always deliver the thrilling, skilful football fan demand. But, on a whole, the league enthrals fans, a exciting stars, such a Jack Grealish, Tammy Abraham and Yannick Bolasie, mix it up with the “blood and thunder” journeymen. The beauty of the league, however, ha always lay in the fact that the big clubs, those who have entered the division with Premier League-quality squads, have always been hit with a rude awakening. Look at Aston Villa, Stoke and Swansea; all expected to return to the top flight a a consequence of having top squads, and finding themselves firmly in mid-table. Rich club not always betting favourite Indeed, the Championship betting market favour club like Leeds United (7/2, Bet365) and Sheffield United (11/2), neither of whom have been in the Premier League for several years. However, that sense of unpredictability can also reward punters. Aston Villa, who boast an excellent squad, can be found at 33/1 to win the division, Stoke and Swansea at 40/1 and 66/1 respectively. Observers of the division will tell you: rule nobody out. The Championship is also furnished with decent television coverage, not usually afforded to other lower league around Europe. However, it is the crowd on matchday that really show how popular the league is. Consider that the Championship wa recently ranked a Europe’s third most attended league in Europe, averaging 11,086368 in 2016/17. That’s bigger than La Liga, Serie A and France’s Ligue 1. Incredible. Finally, there are some intangible element to the Championship that also elicit excitement from football fans, namely the stature and history of the club in the division: Table-toppers Leeds, one of the biggest club in English football history. Nottingham Forest, an intriguing long-shot bet at 25/1 to win the league, the club of Brian Clough and European Cup glory. Others, like Aston Villa and Blackburn Rovers, have all played a role in shaping the nature of English football over the decades. Seeing these club struggle and then finally break the bond to reward fan can be a joy to behold. Long may it continue.',\n",
       " 'The inside of a sprayer plane that seed chemtrails into the atmosphere The report, published in the Population Science Journal, followed trend in every country from 1950 to 2017 and found a rapid decline in fertility that ha not been a surprise to scientists. “If one take into account that in the West, the high usage of plastics, especially in supermarkets, and in food production, a well a chemical like Bisphenol A which are put into bottled water and tin cans, a well a the myriad of chemical put into food, hormone in meat, fertilizer and poison in fruit/vegetables, vaccinations, wifi, cell phone radiation, GMO food, and the daily spraying of the sky by specialist aeroplanes, then there is absolutely no surprise that fertility rate have fallen in developed nations,” a scientist commented about the fall in fertility. Chemtrails are different to regular contrail left by passenger jet which dissipate almost immediately. Chemtrails are thick chemical laden deposit pumped out by specialist jet which criss cross the sky spraying the atmosphere. If one watch chemtrail seeding, the process is very slow a the stream of chemical keep their linear form for awhile then morph into a cloud eventually falling to earth distributing the chemical far and wide over a large area. It is not known what composes the chemical that fall on to the population and surrounding countryside below, however the statistic of a fall in fertility and vast rise in cancer since the 1950s do give an indication. There is, a of yet, no official explanation for spraying the sky with thick chemical which fall onto the earth. One must understand that this spraying ha been going on for decades, and is vehemently denied to even exist. Many people are too engrossed in their mobile phone or their life to even look up into the sky these days, and many are asleep to what is happening around them. Western nations, and those above government, are killing their population off with mass produced shit food, chemicals, and factory farming a well a the societal decline of the family from year of feminism. In 1950, woman were having an average of 4.7 child in their lifetime. The fertility rate all but halved to 2.4 child per woman by last year compared to the fertility rate in Niger, west Africa, is 7.1, but in the Mediterranean island of Cyprus woman are having one child, on average. As developing and third world nation advance their country economically, they too will be targeted. The acceleration of infertility, cancer and other illness which are a symptom of developed first world nations, will soon encompass the whole globe resulting in an overall reduction in population.',\n",
       " 'Feminism is now in it last death throe and many are welcoming a dawning of a new age, where free love reign and puritanism is resigned to history. Professor Jonah Collins, at the University of Wichita, revealed the intricacy of the sudden change in mood. “When you have an age of puritan, politically correct, sexless boredom, people eventually have enough. You can’t pit the sex against each other forever, eventually love win through. This is what we’re seeing with the latest data. People want to have fun again, be happy, have lot of sex, and forget about the Marxist social justice warrior trying to indoctrinate them to hate the other sex.” Instead of hating, would it not be better for feminist to love? Gina Munche, a former feminist used to hate men but ha seen the error of her ways. “I had been indoctrinated to hate men. Through school to university, that is all we were taught. Day in day out. I used to be an activist saying that all men should die and be killed, but one day I wa walking home and tripped and fell on the sidewalk. I busted my head bad, and many woman walked away. Then one guy he knelt down to help me. At first I wa about to say I didn’t need no man’s help, but he went and pulled me up, and called an ambulance a I wa cut up pretty bad. This guy didn’t ask for anything, he helped me in the ambulance and assured me that I would be okay. That’s the last I saw him. From then on, I know that all men ain’t bad. All men don’t want to rape women.” Since that moment Gina threw off her SJW anti-male activist hat and instead embraced men. These are some of the reason many woman who were previously indoctrinated in the soviet-style feminism and third wave are seeing that love is the true force of the universe, and not hatred. Men are no better than women, and vice versa, and we are all here for a specific reason, a the natural biological function requires.',\n",

There have been sporadic incident of child refusing to carry knife or participate in frenzied stabbing session down the local chippy near the school. “Education Secretary, Ron Shank, wa down here last week and he disapproved of the low number of mass stabbings that go on on a daily basis. He said that we are well down in the Labour Mayor, Sadiq Khan’s stab league and we should therefore get more funding to buy more knife for our school this year from central government,” Headmaster of Stabbington Primary in Tulse Hill, South London, told the BBC. These certainly are worrying time for the Labour mayor who for two year ha put all his effort into producing a sub-class of feral child that are terrorising the general population and encouraging a climate of perpetual fear. The Labour mayor ha refused any responsibility in the deterioration of attack and urge more to be done, like decreasing police number further. Stab Britain Young boy especially in deprived area of London are being ostracised for not carrying enough knife to school or participating in stabbings. Yesterday, in Prime Minister’s questions, Home Secretary Sajid Javid put forward a plan to integrate more child into the stabbing culture: “Children who have grown up in the London area where stabbing number have dropped significantly must be transferred to area where the London mayor still ha not implemented a halt to police presence. We are doing our best to reduce police numbers, and I have ordered police to concentrate their resource to prosecuting Twitter hate crimes.” Since the Labour London mayor, Sadiq Khan ha been in power, he ha reduced the number of police on the street and ha made a concerted effort to encourage violent crime so that normal citizen have to live in perpetual fear of death. Under Sadiq Khan’s Labour mayorship London is now a crime ridden bloodbath where wild rat feral child happily celebrate their tenth birthday with a stabbing or two thus pleasing their friends, and it seems the current mayor’s office.',\n",

This sad terrible episode at the Borderline Bar and Grill, is positively another provocation, and we may soon see an escalation of politically motivated killing occur in America. The timing of the shooting just after the midterm election, and the recent firing of Attorney General Jeff Sessions doe suggest there is political motive, especially within such a polarised country. One minute you might be innocently line dancing, the next, you could be on the ground with multiple gunshot wounds.

The same go for democrat politician like Maxine Waters who ha urged violent opposition on any Trump supporter and those who work in the White House. Is this open season on Trump, especially after the massive win of Senators in the recent Midterm elections? The likelihood and probability to that question is, yes. There are already group like Antifa who freely discus murdering conservative supporter on Twitter. These individual and group are given carte blanche and freedom to plan their mission without any censorship or banning because they are left-wing. There could also be a backlash from other groups, the mid-American military militias, who feel that they are under attack by the mainstream leftist media. The table have strangely twisted around, where the socialist democrat are now the aggressor and acting like Nazis, when they claim they are fighting the very same thing. Banning gun in America will not solve anything either because they will just go underground, and many will die defending their right to own arms. If any administration ever try to ban guns, there will most definitely be a civil war. Naturally, the motive of this heinous act will probably be watered down, so a not to inflame tension between the two political side fighting each other by the authorities, however they should be honest with citizen and not cover anything up.

       " 'You could hear a pin drop amongst the #MeToo movement last night when a female White House microphone handler wa assaulted by a rabid CNN reporter, called Jim Acosta. “If the female intern wa a liberal, there would have been a great uproar, and the #MeToo movement would have voiced their outrage at the blatant assault, however because she wa working in a Republican White House, there wa only silence. Suffice to say, it is okay to assault conservative woman but not socialist women,” a shocked observer of the whole sorry affair remarked. Jim Acosta, is not only known for his unsubtle methods, but his brutish questions, and his behaviour towards woman it seems. “She wa just trying to do her job, her beautiful immaculate hair, her pristine smooth porcelain skin, one assumes she is barely over the age of 21. Who is this temptress who gripped the microphone so tightly, her perfectly manicured slender finger held on for a long a she could, but wa brutally assaulted in plain sight by this horrible man who call himself a reporter? She awkwardly stood back, yet still held her womanly poise, a startled Bambi in the woods, and then eventually she took the mic and handed it to the NBC correspondent. If Bill Clinton had viewed this debacle, he too would have been stirred by this beautiful intern struggling with all her strength to keep her hand on the microphone. For a start, she is mile better looking than Monica, ha a great grip, and ha the ability to kneel down with such demure prowess,” a White House observer revealed yesterday. It is quite right that Jim Acosta, the accoster of the unimaginably hot female intern mic holder should be barred from the White House for his ungentlemanly violent conduct, but still, it is a disgusting detriment to the so-called #MeToo movement that there ha been nothing but silence to what happened to this poor woman just trying to do her job in the White House. Last night wa proof positive that the #MeToo movement is a sham, and only a politically motivated tool that benefit left-wing women. It doe not care a damn if a conservative woman is assaulted by a man, therefore the movement is a one-sided vehicle of socialism and soviet style political ideology.

Thankfully though now that Europe’s border are much more accessible, it ha bought with it a rise in Soccer tourism and the city of Prague is at the forefront of a burgeoning industry that ha grown over the past decade or so. Admittedly the standard of Soccer on display might not be at the very highest level especially when compared to the like of La Liga in Spain or the English Premier League, but the atmosphere once in the ground is one that cannot be rivalled. Add the fact that the ticket price are not the eye watering sum that would usually find when watching the like of Real Madrid and Manchester United and a trip to one of Prague’s Soccer club doe actually represent good value for money. While one should not also forget the fact that Czech lager is some of if not the best produced in the world, so what better combination could there be then a couple of cold pint of Pilsner Urquell while taking in a game.

The club have won no fewer than 33 domestic league titles, more than any other club. However, it must also be mentioned that they have not reached the summit of the Czech First League since the 2013/14 when they last won the title. They may be going through something of a fallow period in time of titles, not winning the league in four year is almost unheard of and it is arguably all the more galling when they have to look at their cross-city rival celebrating success of their own. LONG TERM RIVALS Every big city need a Soccer rivalry and Prague is no different, for every Sparta fan there is also a fan of Slavia also. In the 2016/17 campaign they won the Czech First League for the first time in eight years. A win that wa all the more sweeter considering that they extended the trophy drought for their arch rival Sparta. In term of historic win though they have not quite managed the same level of overall success. Slavia have been fortunate enough to win the Czech First League just 17 time in comparison to Sparta’s impressive 33. Therefore, arguably Prague’s second club are going to have a lot of work to do if they are to rule the roost in term of trophies. However, there is not just the rivalry between Sparta and Slavia that is offer should you decide to take in a game during your time in Prague. This hot bed of Sport also offer up the possibility to watch other classic clubs. OTHER OPTIONS One that spring to mind is that of FK Dukla Prague, arguably made famous thanks to the song by British band ‘Half Man Half Biscuit’ who released the modest 1986 hit ‘All I Wanted Was A Dukla Prague Away Kit’ Arguably one for the Soccer hipsters, a visit to watch Dukla unfortunately is not quite what it would have been before hand. This is due to the fact that the club it original guise ceased to exist in 1996 when it merged with FC Pribram. So here you have a choice, you can either follow the original Dukla Prague in their new legacy a they are called 1. FK Pribram, however that would mean dropping down to the second tier of Czech Soccer. Or one the other hand if you feel you need your Dukla fix, then this is possible thanks to the club that ha taken over the mantle. Although not legally recognised a the natural successor, FK Dukla Prague ha gone a long way to restoring the pride that wa once felt in the club. After winning the Czech Second Division in the 2010/11 season, they have since been a mainstay in the First League, and although they do not quite get the attendance figure that Slavia and Sparta do their fan are no le passionate. The list of option doe not end their though, Bohemians 1905 should certainly not be forgotten. As the name perhaps suggests the club wa started more than a century ago and although they have been a staple in Czech Soccer they have managed just a solitary league title. One that came over 30 year ago, back in 1982/83 to be precise. Since then their maiden Czech First League title they have failed to get anywhere near being the team to beat but again they have an ardent fan base that one day hope that they will return to the very top. With the amount of option available to you, there is no reason not to check out a game of Soccer while embarking on your Prague visit. The only question is which team will you lending your support too?',\n",

Dirty trick and election meddling “If it wa not for the illegal alien who we helped get across the border and gave them lot of free stuff, they would not have voted democrat. If it wa not for the massive internet purge project by socialist tech company prior to the Midterms, then the story would have been very different. The socialist purge of hundred of thousand of conservative leaning bloggers/political pundits/news sites, really worked, because we silenced their voices. They were party to mass illegal underhand practice and electioneering engineered to benefit the democrats, so we are proud of those tech companies, thank you. This is why illegal immigration and censorship is so important to us,” Nancy Pelosi, tearful but joyous told the press after the final result came through.

The vindictive nature of socialism leaf question on what investigation will be more damaging to Trump, his tax affair or the ongoing Mueller investigation? The good news of the night included the loss of Texas for Beto O’Rourke whose campaign worker misused campaign funds, but will never be investigated by the FEC. “The dems are looking to impeach Trump any way they can, whether he drop a paperclip or leaf the toilet seat up, and they will find some piece of dirt to render him useless. He can forget about that wall being ever built, or that 14th Amendment bull. He’s a dead duck walking!” another jubilant democrat yelled after the result came in. The Democrats are right. You can win if you take away the voice of the other candidate in an election. By silencing the opposition through illegal, immoral purge and massive censorship, you can win. You can also win by harnessing the power of bribery, by helping million of illegal alien into the USA, you can tell them they have to vote democrat, and they will be your numbers, they will be your army, and it really doe work a a technique that the Republicans do not utilise.

Brexit voter were promised an end to EU rule, this meant an end to the UK under the Customs Union, and end to free movement and an end to rule from the ECJ and other EU controlling factors. One of the main reason for voting wa to get our parliament back, a a sovereign British parliament, not dictated to by Brussels. Sovereign freedom of Britain, to make our own law again, and not be subjected to restrictive authoritarian rule a prescribed by the EU. The Conservative party throughout the last two year ha shown great weakness, and an untrustworthy side which is frankly unnerving. If Mrs. May say one thing, then doe the complete opposite thing, whilst still saying she is honouring the will of the people, this is a blatant lie, and her lie have been very damaging not only to her own integrity but to the integrity of the party a a whole. Theresa May and her Remainer Chancellor, Philip Hammond, along with her Remainer Brexit adviser, Olly Robbins are lying blatantly to Brexit voter daily a they prepare to push through the Chequers Brino deal which will doom Britain to become a vassal state to the EU indefinitely without a legal way out of the Customs Union. No one will vote for the Conservative party in 2020 who is not a Remainer. Yes, they will get some vote from the pro-EU faction, but the majority of people who voted for Brexit will vote with their foot and walk away from the Tories. The Conservative party today is a disgrace, and they will be duly punished for their treachery and treasonous lie towards the electorate a well a their perversion of democracy within the UK. The biggest fatality is democracy, because what we have seen in the last two years, is that there is very little of it left in Britain today. No justice, or democracy leaf a land which is seething with self hatred and is unjust, with little or no value anymore. To this end, it will be deemed a appropriate that many will abandon the Conservative party because of Theresa May and her cronies. These monstrous liars, quisling and treacherous chicken-hearted waster who have demeaned Britain’s highest establishment with their all hat and no cattle empty worthless words, will be doomed to the opposition bench for the next thirty or forty years. Yes, by not voting Conservative anymore, the million who voted for Brexit, will condemn Britain and the Conservative party to a purgatory worse than any death — the Labour party. We’ve lost everything else so we have nothing left to lose. This action alone will be fit enough punishment for the nation but it will be a lesson hard learned for the Tories, who stood by a their party wa trashed asunder by the like of Theresa May and her treacherous entourage of yellow lickspittle coward and traitors.

       " 'George Soros is certainly not someone who doe thing in halves, and his latest purchase certainly prof it. The Landing Craft, Tank, (LCT) wa made famous in campaign like D-Day, and the Pacific war in the Second World War. The most common LCTs were the Mk5 LCT, which were used by British and American troop to land on the Normandy beach on June, 6, 1944. Most of the LCTs were set for the scrap yard, however were saved by the plentiful money trench that is George Soros’ bank account. “He came into our office and saw a picture of one of our scrap LCTs. He asked me how many I had, and when I said 40,000, he took out his cheque book and wrote down a figure. He handed it to me, and I had to sit down. I just said take them, and he did,” Miles Kapernicko, the owner of one of the world’s biggest shipyard told Shipping magazine. It is not known what the price paid wa for all the LCTs however an expert in the field estimated it to be in the region of $4,000 000 000 at 100k a piece. Many of the scrap LCTs will also need extensive repair to make them seaworthy again, adding on extra cost to the Soros project. No one know exactly what Soros is going to do with the landing craft, however some have an idea. “This will be like D-Day on Juno beach, or Omaha, but most probably will be migrant from South America onto the beach of California, or from Morocco or Libya onto Italian, Spanish and Greek beaches. Our guess is that the number of landing craft landing at the same time will be unstoppable. No authority can possibly stop that sort of invasion, and under the term of the Geneva convention, these migrant would be classed a non-combatants and will all be accepted a asylum seekers. Many who land will just rush into land and disappear,” Johan Demisires, an expert on illegal migration told the Washington Times. If Soros can pull off migrant caravan on land, he can certainly pull off a sea invasion force numbering over 40,000 craft. If each craft can carry a capacity of 4,000 migrants, this would mean an illegal migrant invasion force of 160,000,000 could be deployed onto any Western nation at any time. The logistics for such an operation would probably be wide and numerous, however Mr. Soros and his empire of helper are more than capable of pulling such an incredible feat off with little or no trouble. “If Soros pull this one off, it will make D-Day look like a Sunday picnic outing. One can imagine the immense power and fear felt seeing one of these migrant naval invasion taking place. It would be a historic event,” historian, Gene Altrew, at the Smithsonian Institute told the Washington Times.',\n",

They started to go red in the face a I chopped away. I thought nothing of it. Then they called me a ‘murderer’ and a ‘killer’ and when I tried to explain that I had not done the killing of the animals, they got even angrier and smothered me with vegan food. I must say, it wa rather delicious, a I had skipped lunch.” One man who wa sitting on a bench eating a sausage roll, wa dragged by his foot to a vegan restaurant and a vegan sausage roll wa stuffed into his mouth forcibly nearly choking him. Three worker on their break were tucking into their beef burger when the vegan mob turned up. One unnamed vegan woman took the bap off the burger then vomited on the meat. She then put the bap back on and forced the men to eat the burger with vomit on them. They were later stretchered off to a hospital. By that time, a mob of vegan converged from the east, and bundled into a kebab shop where they screamed at the top of their voice at the staff. The vegan led a live goat and sheep into the kebab shop and forced the staff and customer to look at the live animal for four hours. After they left, the staff and customer were so traumatised that they threw down their kebab and fled. At one shop selling milkshakes, a lactating woman removed her top and proceeded to shout ‘cow milk is extracted from grieving mothers’, she then squirted milk from her breast into the milkshake of customer whilst cry at the top of her voice. To her astonishment some customer continued drinking their milkshake afterwards. All across the country, many town were simultaneously attacked in what seems to be a coordinated attack.

I asked an assistant to remove the employee trendy $450 moccasins, and socks. This form of torture and education is accepted fully in China so there wa nothing to worry about. We then brought out a long flexible stick and beat the sol of his feet, all the while asking who he pledge allegiance to. At first, the scream were too loud for any word to be understood, but on the 40th stroke, he started to sound like a communist again. ‘Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao!’ he yelped. He wa then taken away on a Gogle stretcher with some fresh frappuccino to recover.

Information officer, Darcy Hernandez, say that compliance to Gogle authoritarian directive are a must within the global population, a well a employed staff on campus: “If you do not comply to our directives, we delete you, we demonetize you, and we effectively ruin your livelihood. You must adhere to all censor when they come telling you to censor your website because it ha a different ideological political message other than communism. Marxism is the only way forward, and we have made this very clear by purging a many websites, and channel from the internet worldwide which we fully control now. We welcomed this week, a group of Chinese censor who very kindly gave u some extra tips, and advised u on best practice to censor non-communist content, and employee who do not agree with our political ideology. You can hide, but we will eventually find you and weed you out. We monitor everything.” Ah, a good day’s work spreading the Chinese communist message of censorship and thought compliance.

The British who are controlling the negotiation are firmly ensconced within the European side, and the real Brexiteers do not have any power in their parliament. We will therefore see a faux removal of the UK from the EU, thanks to Theresa May and her euro-centric Cabinet. This folly, will enable May to declare she completed the will of the people however in reality, Britain will be firmly placed within EU law and regulation indefinitely. Britain ha already eaten the multicultural pill, and there is no going back, however much some may try to reverse things. “The main raison d’etre for the Pan-European project wa to counteract the Russian threat, a well a bolster Europe’s standing next to the super power of the United States. For this to engender a tactical advantage within the Western European diaspora there would have to be a genetic blend imported into Europe, to increase diversity, and plant the seed of global acceptance. The homogenous nature of Europe must be bred out generationally, to create a new European, one who is a blend of many global bloodlines. This is why German Chancellor, Angela Merkel accepted with open arm over a million refugee from the Middle East in 2015. Similarly, Southern Italy ha seen a deluge of human traffic from the African continent, which under the Coudenhove-Kalergi plan is key to increasing Europe’s diverse population targets. “Throughout the past three or four decades, we have seen the integration within Europe of diverse genetic mixture flourish, and even though there have been attempt to halt this mixing, it ha continued, and will continue until the whole of Europe is composed of a darker hue, from the extremity of the southern border to the north, east, and west. “The European project will move forward a planned, and so will it single currency. “Across the Atlantic Ocean, we have the United States, who is momentarily resisting the Coudenhove-Kalergi plan of integration, the pan-American uniting force of South and North America will go ahead despite the aspiration of Mr. Trump, who is imprisoned within a socialist system he alone cannot change. The only way Trump can change thing permanently is to start a civil war, and win it. This latter scenario is highly unlikely, and the eventual demise of Mr. Trump will herald the resumption of the Coudenhove-Kalergi plan to unite the South with North America, relinquishing any national borders. The momentum for this break down in North American sovereignty is too great to stop without military intervention, and it is highly improbable that Trump will resort to such methods. “As new regimes, within nation states, come and go, there will be a stop and start method towards the Coudenhove-Kalergi plan, and this is perfectly permissible simply because this plan extends to centuries, and wa never intended a a quick fix program. “We know of the challenge facing integration of certain global area like Russia and China, but these will come eventually under the auspex of the Coudenhove-Kalergi plan. “All nation state will be moulded a one eventually, all holding an ethnically heterogeneous model, all border will become like the EU’s Schengen zone, and eventually governance of all global section will be ruled a one, centrally from Europe. The human race, will abhor nationalism to any particular state, and will only hold allegiance to the global state, where all economic, judicial, and every-day governance will preside.” Former EU President Herman Van Rompuy wa awarded the European Prize Coudenhove-Kalergi 2012 “Peace and the European idea” for his exemplary work towards EU integration.

Up above the high rises, the sky may be blue but it is replete with white line criss crossing the air, these mysterious line appearing from plane working day and night churning out chemical that drop slowly onto the ground, to be ingested by the unknowing unawake population. The filthy pot holed roads, now a car park where the increase in traffic ha been so immense from the EU, vehicle barely move over 15 MPH, people resigned to sitting in their car twiddling their thumb just stare out of their car into nothingness. Driving in London is now such a nightmare, that it is preferable to simply crash your vehicle into a lamp post and walk. More cash ha been allocated for the NHS we hear. That’s not what we find in the local GP’s office where queue of sick people snake out into the road, many too ill to stand just lie on the cold pavement and close their eye in painful resignation to their fate. It can now take month to get a single appointment at your surgery. The immense influx of migrant over the year ha effectively destroyed the NHS’ ability to function. God forbid you need hospital help, well you’re shit out of luck, there are no bed left. If you live in London, the daily stab victim coming through the door are in a constant loop, blood and piece of flesh dripping all over the tiles, and a you sit for your next appointment in eight hour time, you will no doubt see more stabbings and shooting directly in front of you, like some sort of theatrical display of death and mayhem played out in grotesque realism. The hospitals, replete with blood stained wall and mattresses, are now place where you go in and never come out again. They call it mercy, because living on a tiny island so overcrowded is like living in a nightmare that you can’t wake up from. If you manage to get an ambulance lottery ride to a hospital, the distraught overworked staff stick you in a corridor on a stretcher amongst the other cadavers. Your wait can last week or months, and sometimes surgery is conducted in the corridor if the doctor ever find your name tag. Many come here to die then are unceremoniously dumped in an oven and your ash blasted over the city, an infernal snowing cloud of human misery. The rule for living in modern day Britain still suffering from mass migration is don’t ever get sick. Do everything you can to never fall ill, or you will put your life in serious danger. Just a Angela Merkel will be remembered a the woman who ruined Germany’s social service system, her counterpart, Tony Blair, will be known for war crimes, unfettered migration and the ruination of schools, hospital and benefits, both of these monster are socialist who have contributed to the destruction of their own nation from within. When Gordon Brown, the Labour Chancellor, and later unelected PM, sold off Britain’s gold reserve at the bottom of the market, he knew very well what he wa doing, and did it with a grim Scottish smile. Let u thus celebrate the end of austerity, maybe on the way to a food bank to get a few rotting turnip to mash into a soup that will sustain you and your family of five until your next meal in a week. The grey miserable city and street of Britain, where the homeless are now part of the furniture, and the daily tax slave begin their day of work so they can take home a few penny after being taxed to the hilt, perpetually rising council tax, electricity bill, water bill, gas bill, internet bill, telephone bill, insurance bill, slashing the wrist and seeing the jet of blood spurt across the carpet and wall are a thankful reprieve to a life of utter meaningless tax slave misery. You are a tax zombie, condemned to a life of commuting for hour every day then death. Your meaningless life only compounded by episode of Come Dancing or Big brother on the BBC taxed television you own in your leaking freezing grey home. It’s another day at work, the bus and train are now full to the brim, the road are the usual car parks, the hospitals, something from the Crimean war, the schools, overloaded where the English language is now a foreign sounding mush of lost syllables. You work the whole day and come home, then go out the next day to work in the same meaningless poorly paid job that destroys every single part of your fucking soul. Stagnant wages, brought down by the million who took the job the Brits were deemed too lazy to do, your EU migrant bos is not happy with you, so he fire you. You breathe a sigh of relief. Maybe it is time to queue for day at the GP’s office and beg to be put on the waiting list for a mobile buggy, to drive you everywhere because you are too lazy to walk anymore. It’s okay though. Wake up. Haw Haw Hammond ha been told to end austerity. Everything is ok now, Britain ha been saved. Hurrah! Just pop more pills, and jam another needle into your ankle, when the mist rise and the comforting opioid blanket cover you in your grey freezing rat infested home, these are the only word that will go through your frazzled mind…austerity..over…austerity…over…auster…',\n",
       " 'One thing about the Theresa May Chequers Plan is that it will be nearly impossible to get out of once it is implemented. This is something the PM ha lied about to her own Cabinet, who are being steered into a deal that will doom the UK to be a ‘vassal state’ of the EU indefinitely. Once the UK is signed up to the custom backstop, minister will not be able to change anything, and there will be no ‘exit mechanism’ to break out of the backstop. Even if the MPs try to change thing legally, this would take decade and most certainly result in failure, Theresa May’s own Attorney General, Geoffrey Cox, ha evaluated. The Chequers proposal involves the permanent continuation in the UK of all EU law which relate to goods. All good on the UK manufactured in the UK for the UK domestic market, or imported from non-EU countries, would be permanently subject to these controls. The obligation to follow the EU rulebook for good would gravely impair the UK’s ability to conduct an independent international trade policy. In particular, it will prevent Britain from including Mutual Recognition Agreements for good in trade treaty and this is likely to destroy the prospect of successfully achieving meaningful agreement with some of the prime candidate such a the USA and Australia. Theresa May’s version of Brexit which is known a a BRINO (Brexit in name only) would condemn the UK to be stuck permanently a a vassal state within the EU’s legal and regulatory swamp. The UK would still have to obey EU law and ECJ ruling hindering it ability to develop an effective international trade policy or adapt the economy to take advantage of the freedom a real Brexit would have afforded it. The Theresa May Chequers capitulation will also mean that Britain will be stuck in the EU with no power to veto, and will still be sending vast amount of money to Brussels, a well a being tied to EU regulation inhibiting it ability to make international trade deals. The destruction of Brexit by Theresa May and her Remainer allies, will ensure that no one who voted for a Brexit on June 23, 2016, will vote Conservative again, due mainly to the immense calculated betrayal by the prime minister and other pro-eu conservative minister who aided and abetted the Chequers capitulation. The Conservative party will be consigned to the political wilderness for the next twenty to thirty years, because losing the vote of the leaver will let in the current opposition. Quite, rightly, no one will trust the Conservative party ever again, because it ha reneged on every promise for Brexit, and abandoned it grassroots.',\n",
       " 'Too obvious. It ha been a whirlwind few week into the run up of the midterm election in the US. It started off with a massive purge of conservative website from social medium and the internet search engines, then went on to the Kavanaugh farce, then the orchestrated migrant caravan, and now we have a Native American Filipino MAGAbomber who ha been made to believe he is a ‘white supremacist’ when he doe not have a drop of Aryan blood in his body, driving around in an insanely ludicrous postered van with picture of Hillary Clinton in crosshairs, sending fake bomb to democrats. If this is not election tampering then what is? These event are beyond any form of satire, however what give everything away is the timing and who benefit from these events. Cui bono? Who benefits? Who stand to gain from all of these orchestrated events? They are all designed to make the democrat look like victims, and thus, the people should vote for them to get the other side out of congress. Anything that make the Republicans look bad, make the democrat look good and get them votes. The magabomber fiasco is almost akin to finding the passport of one of the 911 hijacker immaculately preserved amongst the pulverised dust of the Twin Towers. Funny how the passport survived in perfect condition and everything else wa crushed to dust. The official story wa of course that a mystery man appeared out of nowhere, handed it to the police chief, then disappeared again, never to be found. Both story are highly implausible. So, we have some idiot driving around in a van practically advertising himself a a security risk, apprehended and detained eventually. Not only is this guy an obvious plant, but he is possibly an alter. He wa most probably vetted for month and then given the go-ahead a week or so before the midterm elections. We will never know the truth, because an operation like this is cloaked in utmost secrecy and this guy’s handler are way out of the picture by now. Now, if you can get a Native American/Filipino person to believe he is a ‘white supremacist, then you can get him to believe and do anything…absolutely anything. Case closed.

       " 'The Global Population Research Institute in Rome, Italy reveals the problem that globalists will have to deal with in the future. “For the past thirty year the West ha been seemingly under attack from forced third world migration, and from economic mean of tying the West to communist region like China. This wa all pre-planned, and orchestrated by key globalist player a well a their counterpart within national governments. “During this major upheaval, whole industry have died, and others have sprouted from their ashes. Whole area of indigenous Western community have seen their country changed permanently by migration from the poorest nations. Cultures have been destroyed, and we have seen massive White Flight from whole city in the West. “This forced globalisation where once rich community have been flooded by the third world, are the work of globalists who did not do their homework. They did not understand the consequence of flooding the West with poorly skilled migrants, million of people who instead of being a positive for the economy have drained it, turned wage down, become a burden on social services, and crowded the hospitals. “There is now a massive polarisation within communities, a vast chasm of ill feeling, and even thought of civil war, a resource run low from the migratory influx. “In Britain, we are seeing Brexit. In Italy we are seeing rebellion. In Hungary more dissent to forced migration. In Germany, the major recipient of migration, we have seen vast community completely ignored by the authority a they cater for the need of migrant over their own citizens. In the USA, we are seeing migrant caravan daily coming from the poorest South American countries, organised by NGOs and other agencies. In France, we are seeing whole boulevard and neighborhood taken over by tent city made up of Sub-Saharan and Middle Eastern migrants. “The plight of these people are a symptom of global overpopulation, unfettered breeding, creating poverty, disease and pollution, then imported into the West by globalists. “Naturally, the elite globalists do not have to contend with this migratory influx. They live away from these areas, secluded in luxurious environs, where every whim is catered for. The globalist elite have special medicine that are not on the civilian market, and live on food that is not tainted by chemical that the rest of the population have to live on. Their water is pure, and every month, large sum of money are deposited in their accounts, not only from the taxpayer, but from their companies. “Globalism is good. Globalism is a necessity when it come to business. The new world order once assimilated will function in a global single market capacity, however the architect of globalism have underestimated the fight for national boundaries. The elite globalists have underestimated thousand of year of European history, and they will have to evaluate how they have misread the process of forcing migration on to Europe and the United States. “Why doe China not take any third world migrants, Japan, Russia or Saudi Arabia? This is a simple question to answer. Because they have designed their society and culture to reject assimilation with any other culture other than their own. This technique is not prevalent with the liberal socialist blank canvas of the West, where to be proud of one’s nation is immediately pounced upon and the individual is labelled a Nazi. Acceptance of migratory force is therefore accompanied by liberal guilt if not adhered to by the mass and governmental factions. “The failed current globalist migratory experiment is now leading to serious unrest in the population of the West. Fractured society cannot be fixed by one singular solution alone, there will have to be many variables, however, the globalists have forcibly fractured whole swathe of people and at high speed creating a doppler effect in population shift factors. “The globalist elite will have to adjust their technique, and move towards stronger method to impart their message. This could involve complete breakup of nation within the global matrix, internal warfare, or even warfare externally across borders. There are more step to take, and they will not be painless. “To exercise change in the long-term, there may have to be some egg broken to make that omelette. True change can only come from a clean slate, a purge of the old system, and ultimately global warfare. This is the only way the new world order will truly rise, because once the globe is purged of the excess, and the old problems, it can start afresh creating the system that doe not need wars, forced migration, mass consumerism, pollution, or mass factory farming. Once this ha been achieved, a controlled population will be assembled which will allow the much needed regeneration of the earth’s resources.”',\n",

The distance of 466 mile ha been crushing to many of the gambler who are grossly obese, and have to have junk food snack every fifteen minutes. “We started at 6.30 am yesterday and we only got eight mile into the journey,” Pamela Bourdain, 38, told CBS local news. The migrant caravan ha taken the American press by surprise because it contains only Americans who are going to besiege Caesars Palace and demand luxury room for all, free meals, and no limit gambling purses. “Blackjack and roulette, and a little bit of poker, then a sauna, some lady of the night, some powder, and a large slap up meal in my room, then more gambling,” another gambler trudging along the highway told news reporter slobbering at the mouth at the very thought of it. Along the route, many resident cheer the gambler along, even throwing casino chip at them to spur them on to their destination. President Trump, a seasoned gambler himself did not condone the migrant caravan of gambler but made a joke about the convoy: “I do not condone a caravan of people walking on their foot to demand thing from other people or nations, but I have ordered Stormy Daniels to be at her post in the casino so when the gambler get there, she will have to service each and every one of them.” When contacted, the management of Caesars Palace, were not sure how to counteract the news that the caravan wa on it way to their casino. “You’re saying that 20,000 gambler in a walking migrant caravan are heading over here? You say they demand free meals, free gambling, free luxury suite and free prostitutes? Anselmo, come here right now. Get them Mexican boy to build a wall around the casino with gun turrets. Nothing is free in Vegas. Nothing!” Chief spokesman for the gambler caravan, Dwight Oros, wa adamant that the gambler convoy had every right to do what they are doing. “We have every right to migrate in our thousand to anywhere we want and demand we get free food, free gambling chips, free luxury suites, and women.

Men get punched, kicked, abused, spat at, and demeaned in every medium that exists today. Women wanted ‘equality’ well you better suck it up buttercup. You can’t just pick and choose which bit of equality you want and discard the nasty bits.” Twisting the heated knife The truth is that Theresa May is seeking to betray Britain by tying it in with the EU Customs Union, ECJ, and Single Market indefinitely, something she said she would not do in the Conservative Manifesto and which go against any EU Referendum voter who voted to leave the EU on June, 23, 2016. Theresa May ha effectively hijacked Brexit and ignored the people’s vote, and created her own Brexit in name only.

       " 'When Marisa Papen grace her presence on a ‘holy religious’ site, she is bringing forth a message of freedom, of sensual nature, art, beauty and the timeless stance of the nude female form over restrictive, needle religious imprisonment. Religion restricts the female form, it imprisons it in useless garments, and denigrates the beauty it exudes within the jail of religious dogma. In Egypt, Marisa ha been put in jail for her endeavour to enlighten the mass from their religious brainwashing, she is the ultimate female warrior, who elucidates the blind religious fanatic a they call for woman to be imprisoned further through ancient rambling scripture written by all male mystic high on mushroom eon ago who were ultimately afraid of the female form and it sacred geometry. Has it come to this, for this female warrior to invade the very rampart of religious fervour with her body, just to prove a point about humanity’s proclivity to create nonsensical religious scriptures? If there is a deity worth worshipping, it is the clean bronzed outline of her perfectly formed as and breast delicately reclining on a carpet in a bazaar, or climbing an Israeli flag pole in Jerusalem. Her latest sojourn entitled ‘Turkish Delight‘ showcase a daring display of bush in the Hagia Sophia mosque, stretched out on the roof tile of Istanbul, boating on the sunset filled Bosphorus, and cosying up on Turkish carpets, amongst many Helmut Newtonesque photographs, which if the DS wa not under serious censorship and puritanical Victorian monopoly-tech-company control would happily publish here right now. The Ottomans were certainly not stranger to the nude female form, however any bush flashing in a mosque would certainly have been dealt with with a swift beheading. Regarding the current climate in Turkey today, she is lucky to have left the country unscathed. Marisa’s own word about her Turkish trip when we asked her to explain some of the reasoning to her art were indeed illuminating. “I believe religion ha done more harm to this world than good. Wars are built upon religion. “As for women, having to cover yourself up from head to toe is incredibly disempowering. I only wore this Burka for a few hour but I felt so imprisoned. The fact that their skin is never exposed to the sun…. Without sunlight there wouldn’t be life. Think about that.. “Of course, it’s easier for religious people to say in a state of denial, and just follow the book. But if everyone would start questioning and thinking for themselves, I believe we would come to the same conclusion. We are all the same and fighting about whose God is not going to help humanity any further.” Marisa Papen ha already been banned by Twitter but can be seen on Instagram or her website.',\n",

When asked why they were marching, many did not actually know, and said simply that they were told to march by their programmers. The EU ‘Non Player Characters’ marched from Park Lane towards Parliament Square where they stood chanting scripted program given to them prior to the march. “We wish to stay in an undemocratic EU, where we are told what to say, what to think and everything is dictated to us. We have been programmed to obey the EU since childhood, and we have taught our NPC child to obey without question too.

Fuck democracy. Fuck privacy. Fuck sovereignty. Fuck individualism. Fuck Freedom! Fuck Freedom!” the EU NPCs all chanted without their own consent or knowledge. Amongst the EU NPCs were a few MPs and celebrity who are in on the game, and are used by the programmer to bolster the deep indoctrination and EU programming. “We are here to oversee that the NPCs do not wake up.

Much like the migrant caravan that swept into Europe in 2015, we are now seeing the same phenomenon on the border of the USA. This time, the migrant caravan started from Honduras, travelling through Guatemala and now Mexico towards the USA. The abyss dividing rich nation with poor is now only too evident globally, a many people see through the internet how the rich Westerners live their lives. The internet ha been the catalyst for a true awakening, when previously those in Third World and Developing nation lived their life in blissful ignorance. Now, they want what Americans have, and they are prepared to die trying to get across the U.S. border. Who is to deny the plight of human desperation, the utter poverty these people are spawned from, and destined to die in a well? America, the richest nation in the world, now headed by President Trump will have to make one of two decisions, a the million in the migrant caravan make it way closer to the border.

This is a human invasion of misery and poverty, with woman and children, but to let them all in will send an even bigger message, it will resonate throughout South America. Yes, you are all welcome, then the torrent will be unstoppable, and America will effectively be inundated.

       " 'A s we all know Brexit is one of the biggest political event to take place in the UK across a few decades. The relationship of Britain with European Unions ha been unsure since Brexit and it impact on the Forex market and other global market is also unclear. Although no matter the impact there is certainly going to be a long lasting effect. GBP Perspective: Due to the surprising event of Brexit the Pound Sterling ha suffered. It wa predicted that because of the country’s high debt situation the exit from the European Union would ultimately mean that the UK would be failing to pay it loans. Fortunately the Forex market is stable and wasn’t dramatically affected by the exit. Traders have to keep a close on eye on their investment and for opportunities. Brexit effect on markets: The UK ha about 44% of it export that go to the European Union and 7% of the European Union’s trade is made up of the UK’s exports. But the effect of a Brexit would mean that the trade would decrease considerably. It’s highly likely that both the EU and the UK would experience a financial slump. However, it is precisely in these situation that anyone involved with CFD trading at broker like City Index, can prosper and hopefully see profit. Forex: The pound sterling is likely to fall considerably if Britain doe end up moving towards a hard Brexit. The Euro could also possibly suffer because of the huge economic shock but the dollar could benefit and increase should investor look to invest their money in a protected economy. This can present an opportunity for Forex trader a they look to take advantage of sharp movement in the markets. Stocks: On the basis of stock you need to be confident precisely which company and industry are most likely to be negatively affected by tariffs, border check and service regulations. The EU tariff are extremely high when it come to agricultural products, clothing, vehicles, food and tobacco. Furthermore, when assessing border check it is inevitable that change in protocol here are most likely adversely affect manufactured good which include electronics, cosmetics, perfume and sport equipment. This sentiment is also true when it come to service such a airlines, transportation business and financial services, where the main fear is how EU regulation will affect the business. Commodities: A hard Brexit could have different effect on investors. Investors could seize the opportunity to invest in safe and secure assets; this would ultimately mean that the price of valuable metal such a gold and silver could rise. There is bound to be a decrease in demand which mean that there will be an increase in inflation. The impact of a hard Brexit is clearly going to have a strong effect on trading but this mean that trader or rather investor need to make smart decision and be wise with what they invest in. With safe and smart decision those who trade could ensure that they are not affected by a hard Brexit.',\n",

CNNPC gave it 5 star out of 5, and so did MSNPC. According to the blurb, the film wa heavily funded by the #NPCToo and NPCLivesMatter N-P-C organisations. The opening scene brings forth a wall to wall NPC crowd all chanting the same thing. Over and over again, the same word are chanted by the NPCs. Hundreds of thousand of them all with the same NPC chant, and the same NPC face, and the same NPC march. This scene last for over two hour a they chant the same old mantra that these brainwashed NPCs like to do on a constant basis. This nightmarish film depicts a dystopian world where brainwashed drone-like NPCs led by their programmers, who are never seen, shout out their Marxist communist mantra to all and sundry. They do not know why they are doing what they are doing, but they do it anyway. They are basically mindless angry soulless automaton roaming the street and shouting at the top of their lungs, without any knowledge of why they are angry in the first place. Frankly after the fourth hour of watching the NPCs marching up and down, chanting “No Fascist USA K – K – K!” I literally wanted to shave my eyeball with a rusty razor and poke my scrotum with knitting needle just to escape this vapid, brainless, banal idiocy. At one point the NPCs started a ‘rape’ chant. “All men are rapists!” By then I decided to toss my popcorn and upturn my iced drink over my head. Another four hour of NPCs screaming about the ‘patriarchy’ and ‘white males’ got me into a cold sweat. I fled the room, I felt dehumanized by the chanting. I could not take anymore. I wa lucky I wa in Portland, Oregon, where these kind of thing never happen in reality. That is, until I stepped outside the cinema straight into a….

Never before ha the African genetic bloodline been introduced to any European royal family throughout the whole of history. Prince Harry must be truly proud of himself for breaking the mould to introduce those African gene into European royal circle with his new wife, the beautiful Meghan,” royal historian Alan Starksy, told the BBC.

Geneticist Dr. Werner Andrell, from the Institute of Genetic Global Research in Lausanne, Switzerland, revealed some interesting point about the new royal arrival. “Colour of the skin doe not matter, because to say it doe is completely racist and unacceptable. It is however fully possible through the generational transfer of gene that the baby will be fully black, maybe only taking a few attribute from Prince Harry like his ginger hair although with negroid characteristics. Some genetic trait can skip whole generation and suddenly appear seemingly out of nowhere.

Monsieur Juncker, will be invited to inter one of his famous fart a a special treat to visitor and many generation to come.” When one enters the fart museum they are instantly amazed at the amount of bottled fart exhibited. “We have bottled fart extending all the way back to 1868. C’est merveilleux. The fart from that particular year wa preserved in quite a large bottle, and is still perfectly sniffable. According to our museum record it wa presented to the museum by the family of a German gentleman of the era, his name, Heinrich Furz, is clearly written on the bottle label. His fart wa preserved after he had ingested a meal of Königsberger Klopse, some Spätzle, and a large portion of Stollen, washed down with copious amount of strong Bavarian ale. “One of our most interesting fart is found from a bottle sealed and labelled in 1964. This vintage fart wa produced from an old lady who at the time lived in a house on rue De L’abreuvoir, where she sold her fart a an aphrodisiac to Parisian gentleman frequenting the local bordel, where the fille de joie would work day and night. It is said that Pablo Picasso, wa a particularly frequent visitor to the Madam’s salon where he sniffed away the peculiar aroma to his heart’s content.

One visitor from Ohio, USA ha visited the museum hundred of time and is today sniffing a fart from 1945. “There wa a certain aftertaste to the nasal palate. An austere aromatic almond smell, resonating with embellishment of beefy farmyard blackcurrant tone furnished with strain of hydrogen sulphide suggesting a smattering of bad egg mixed slightly with the heady bouquet of chaptalised cat’s urine. One of the more unique fart I have smelled. Let me have a look at the bottle, ah, this one wa siphoned from the asshole of a Vichy collaborator governmental official who had recently been captured after the second world war had ended. Marvelous, I would never have guessed.” To celebrate 150 year of farts, the museum is giving away a small bottle of vintage fart gas to every visitor who come to the museum from the date of 15 October to January 5th 2019.

       " 'E veryone can identify a hipster from a mile away. The de facto hipster uniform consists of a flannel shirt (the looser the fit, the better), a pair of suspenders, and a pair of Converse trainer or Doc Martens boot (bonus point if they’re seriously beat-up). But have you ever stopped to wonder why that shifty-looking young person became a hipster in the first place? Have you ever asked them to put down their can of Pabst Blue Ribbon (the hipster drink of choice), to actually have a conversation with them? We’re guessing that the answer to those question is no. If you had, you may be surprised with what they’d tell you. Hipsters are Just Unemployed Lumberjacks What our research ha brought to light is that it’s no coincidence that the clothing worn by hipster just happens to be the exact same uniform that lumberjack wear to work each day. Hipsters are just unemployed lumberjacks, left out of work due to the shift to a digital age, where people don’t need such primitive tool such a notebook and paper for printer because they have note apps on their mobiles, and emails. There’s not even a need for book any more since e-readers like the Amazon Kindle are en vogue, letting everyone everywhere squint at screen to get their Harry Potter fix or that oh-so-scandalous fanfic that turned into a light BDSM franchise. And it’s not just fiction book that are going out of style either. Bingo hall have even ditched their paper bingo books, with the Buzz Bingo bingo club chain adopting electronic tablet inside of it venues. Just to add salt to the wound of these poor, out-of-work woodcutters, there are even bingo apps that let people play on the go. Sales of print newspaper are declining, meaning your fish and chip will no longer be flavoured by the tangy, metallic taste of printer ink. And who need magazine when you’ve got your Facebook newsfeed anyway, and who care that it’s full of targeted advertising and malicious troll paid by shady groups? Will Lumberjacks Ever Get Their Jobs Back? But it’s not all bad news for the humble hipster either! They needn’t sit around figuring out how to make their fixie bike startup take off or trying to hawk rotary phone to passersby on the street (never eBay, that’s far too mainstream). There are plenty of alternative to keep lumberjack in work. For example, they could go overseas and become the Brawny mascot, being the official face of kitchen roll and wet wipe everywhere! But come to think of it, a the paper towel brand is known for it product lasting a while, this could potentially put other lumberjack out of business. Other top career suggestion include being a software engineer, a human resource manager, or a financial planner. Why not become a master coder and make your own apps? Or drag unruly employee back into line? A financial planner would also be a fun job so long a you can count, or if you know the basic function of a calculator! And while these career are not hipster-friendly nor doe lumberjacking offer any transferable skill that would help in these jobs, given that lumberjacking is considered one of the worst job you can do, and software engineer/HR manager and financial planner are considered some of the best, we’d say that it’s a considerable step up. Don’t be sad, hipster of the world. Felling tree isn’t the only career out there!',\n",

The cinematography is borne from the lens of this talented Russian beauty, who now resides in Israel and Paris, a powerful mix of destination to formulate her art.

Watching the video, there is a touch of Danny Boyle, Trainspotting going on, and maybe some Abel Ferrara added into the mix. We’re not sure what type of fashion item this video could sell, but it style is most certainly within the expensive perfume niche.

       " 'Nothing ever come easy in life, one ha to fight for every little scrap, whether it is the last morsel of food in a family of ten children, or that elusive A grade in an exam, or that job application where thousand have applied. Freedom, and the right to free speech is much the same, but this concept is the hardest fought battle, for there are many who seek to remove this human right from our table. There are many today who actively seek to remove the right our forefather fought for to the death, and these enemy of freedom are working in concert to completely erase hundred of year of work in one fell swoop. Just a our forefather fought for freedom, there will come a time soon when many will say enough is enough, and they will too wake up to what is going on. The insipid totalitarian tiptoe of soviet communist ideology which seek to remove our Western democratic freedom by uttering their Newspeak. Utilising selective keywords to describe their purge of free expression; anything that is not their ideology is thus deemed a ‘hate speech’, and anything that question their robotic Orwellian narrative is called ‘fake news’. These linguistic term can be used to remove anything they want, and without any recourse or explanation, such is their anti-freedom fervour. The underhand tactic for removing freedom of speech, is one that ha been utilised many time in Soviet country of the past and present, in the USSR, in East Germany, and in Maoist China. Soviet creation like feminism, and political correctness are also a tool used to undermine free speech and freedom. Unfortunately for those who value freedom, these communistic force reside in much of the medium and Silicon Valley. Infiltrated — the higher echelon of government, and the intelligence agencies, work in consortium with the communist sympathising medium element and tech conglomerate to purge all form of dissent of the Soviet communist ideology to which they subscribe to. Communism is now pushed in American universities, and British university a the only way forward, even though this totalitarian political ideology ha been responsible for over 160 million death throughout history with it great purges. The youth of today are being thus trained a ‘Comrades’ and ‘Bolshevik’ fighters, who abhor freedom of speech, privacy or any form of individualism. They instead only support the collectivist mantra spoken by their Marxist professors, who send these brainwashed robot into the world to prepare them for the coming attempt to eradicate democracy, freedom and capitalism. Thomas Jefferson once said: “The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriot and tyrants.” What the ‘useful idiots’ do not know, however is that if they were to take full control and complete their mission of installing a full communist state, they themselves would be purged, in the first instance. This is what communist do, the higher echelon of the communist structure, order the death of all who helped them get into power, for a very simple reason, they have been tricked into believing the ideology in full, and are thus deemed dangerous, because if they feel betrayed in anyway, they will turn on their leaders, and the hierarchy doe not want that threat looming over them. To stop this communist takeover, which ha unfortunately infected much of the previously moderate left-wing media, the fight will be long and arduous, and those who value freedom, will have to have help from those in government who value freedom a well. From the lowest point to the highest point of government, we must have your assurance that you will do everything you can to clean the swamp, to eradicate the Marxists from their position of power, to extricate their funding, to devalue their anti-freedom push, and to disable their method of undermining our inherent right to free speech. The biggest threat, of course to the West today is China, and it Maoist ideology ha infiltrated the West, including the left-wing tech medium companies. One search engine monopoly is even working on a Chinese censored search engine, which they will use a a model to infiltrate the Western model. One social medium company ha a devout communist CEO, who even speaks Mandarin, and ha married a Chinese wife. He ha been completely indoctrinated in Maoist communist ideology, and is seeking to expand his already large empire into China. This will involve more censorship and the disavowment of democracy, free speech. The EU, is another major threat to freedom. This is a totalitarian entity that ha already impacted on freedom of speech and utilises it economic might to force nation to comply with it communist collectivist ideologies. This anti-democratic state is run solely by unelected official in the EU Commission. In Britain today, there is a big fight going on to extricate the UK from this un-democratic authoritarian manifestation, and to bring back Britain’s sovereign free status, a well a it freedom to make it own laws, and conduct it own trade deals. The fight is further compounded by the communist voice within the UK who are trying to thwart Britain’s exit. The sheer depth of the infiltration of these communist operative into the West is immense, and it will possibly take many decade to fight for our freedoms, that our forefather fought for all those year ago. “Freedom of speech is a principal pillar of a free government: When this support is taken away, the constitution of a free society is dissolved.” Founding Father Benjamin Franklin. If you don’t want your children, their children, and their grandchildren, to live in a totalitarian communist dictatorship where there is no freedom of speech, freedom of expression, then you must act now, you must make your voice heard, vote those who subscribe to socialist communist ideology out of office, deny the socialist power by not using their services, boycott those who deny freedom by censoring, and you must ultimately help those who wish to change this communistic creep that is setting in on our once Western democratic free society by fighting with all of your might to get rid of them once and for all. Once we lose that right to free speech…it’s never coming back…that’s it…gone. “If men are to be precluded from offering their sentiment on a matter, which may involve the most serious and alarming consequence that can invite the consideration of mankind, reason is of no use to us; the freedom of speech may be taken away, and dumb and silent we may be led, like sheep, to the slaughter.” — George Washington, first U.S. president',\n",

The Nasdaq Composite skipped a few step down by 4 percent to 7,422.05 and the S&P 500 dropped like a fucking concrete block by 3.3 percent to 2,785.68, with the tech sector pulling the index under like an anchor tossed into the Atlantic ocean. These are early day yet, because we still have a 60% drop to contend with. So, what’s causing all this stuff to happen? Well, there are multiple variable causing the little drops. The main issue is of course China, who are not playing ball with Trump’s tariff changes. The Chinese are intent on bringing some chaos to the U.S. market utilising underhand methods, after Trump trumped their easy money-making deal where they were stiffing America with unfair trade deals. Let’s say, there’s the dumping of U.S. bonds, a China is pretty much the largest holder of U.S. debt, and there’s the retaliatory tariff on U.S. import into China. This whole clusterfuck put a strain on manufacturer and company on both sides. Wherever there is China, there is always Russia, and the sanction put on the country by the U.S., EU, and UK, have created a deeper alliance with the Chinese economically, a well a politically. Then we have the U.S. tech company colluding with each other to censor everything on the internet that is not socialist, or communist. This action ha reawakened a serious investigation into anti-trust regulation, which will break-up many of these monopoly company who have misused their position of power for the gain of the socialist movement in America. Regulators are already prepping to proceed with slapping these company with serious fine and regulations, a well a breaking the bigger one up into smaller manageable sizes. These are just a few variables, we have mentioned, a there are many more, like rate rises, but we don’t want to write this shit all day. Grumble, whisper…martial law…Capitol Hill arrest for treason…Silicon Valley arrest for corruption/meddling with elections…whisper…whisper..cleaning the swamp..FBI/CIA insiders…midterms..etc..

       " 'One thing for u over the pond, that we find strange, is the term used for the American socialist party, the Democrats, named a “Liberals”. The term liberal, in a political sense suggests someone who is “favouring individual liberty, free trade, and moderate political and social reform.” However, to see what the so-called ‘liberals’ are doing in America a of late, is profoundly ‘illiberal’ and extremist. That is to say, they are the antithesis of what they say they are, and have somehow metamorphosed into a totalitarian, authoritarian Marxist political ideology, befitting soviet communism in many ways. We can see this with the coordinated anti-free speech movement of the American socialist within monopoly tech and medium companies, and the move further left, with massive censorship and cutting off the voice of million of people who do not hold extreme leftist political ideals, a well a the attempted destruction of the right for citizen to defend themselves with arms, enshrined in the American constitution. The extreme left of the democratic party, not only want to destroy the right of Americans to speak freely, but to destroy their right to defend themselves with arms, a well a their right to fair election by denying other political ideology a voice in a free stable level playing field platform where all form of political ideology and speech are allowed. The democrat party member and offshoots, like ANTIFA and BlackLivesMatter have also advocated violent internal-terroristic action against any other political ideology that doe not adhere to their extreme Marxist viewpoint. These people still call themselves ‘liberals’ but to watch them aggressively beating up old frail men at protest who dare to hold up their placard and pepper spraying them in the face is far from any set of defined liberal attitude but one of the the out of control mob. The ‘liberals’ today do not value freedom of expression or speech, they do not value capitalism or democracy, they do not value the right of citizen to defend themselves from harm, they do not believe in individualism, and they do not value nation state controlling border for security purposes. What we see from today’s American socialist today is a movement that is bolstered by communist ideology, utilising the disenchanted youth, minorities, and illegal migrant to impose their extremist Marxist viewpoint onto everything and everyone in a totalitarian manner. Through violence, aggression, censorship and authoritarian measures, American socialist have soiled their own so-called ‘inclusive’, ‘progressive’ status to become extremist utilising any mean possible, legal or illegal to push forward the sovietized programming they have all received. Our observation, form afar, is one out of the box, and is profoundly unbiased a we do not hold any political ideology, left, centre, or right. We are mere observers, who see thing a they truly are, almost like a mirror image, and we report what we see a truth. Let u hope one day the American ‘liberals’ find liberalism.',\n",

We wish to punish the Brexit voters, not only in a vindictive sense, but a a greater part of Project Fear which ha been running since the EU Referendum. Our master in Brussels give me my order daily and I follow these order without question. I also follow order from Olly Robbins, who ha now take over Brexit negotiation to make it the softest Brexit we can possibly have, in other words, it will be Brexit only in name,” Philip Hammond told the Financial Times today. All of this of course serf a due notice, that many will abandon the Conservatives in the next election. This Brexit budget punishment compounded with a Brexit betrayal by the Remainer controlled Cabinet and Whitehall, will ensure the Conservatives do not sniff power for decades. Contempt of the electorate and democracy “It is certainly a rebuff to the Brexit voter by punishing the electorate with such a budget. This vindictive nasty behaviour is however quite natural for Remainers like Philip Hammond and his ilk. It is to be expected, a they do not seem to care that the electorate and grassroots never forget the indignity foisted on them by these pathetic lowly traitor to Britain,” one MP said in parliament. Amongst the so-called Brexiteers in parliament, there ha only been mostly silence, and a few whimper of dissent, otherwise they’re towing the party line, kept in step by the whips, cracking away on their yellow spines. The stench of urine and faeces now permeates the hall of the House of Commons and Lords, a they are a place bereft of democracy, and now completely taken over by the soviet totalitarian force of the EU, usurping Britain’s sovereign status indefinitely, and enabled by the vile traitor within the wheel of government.',\n",
       " 'We pay for our own chain After stealing the private data of billion of people, and being caught committing many act of corruption, Facebook want you to install an Orwellian Facebook Portal telescreen in your home which will follow you around wherever you go. This Facebook device with a camera and listening device may one day have to be installed in every home a a compulsory measure, but for now, it is being introduced a a voluntary purchasable option. Yeah! As if anyone would be mad enough to trust a company that actively access user private data, and sell it to any government agency or business that want it. Inside the flat a fruity voice wa reading out a list of figure which had something to do with the production of pig-iron. The voice came from an oblong metal plaque like a dulled mirror which formed part of the surface of the right-hand wall. Winston turned a switch and the voice sank somewhat, though the word were still distinguishable. The instrument (the telescreen, it wa called) could be dimmed, but there wa no way of shutting it off completely. What kind of a moron would pay for their own surveillance? Well, there are many millennials today, who will no doubt be queuing round the block to purchase this portal, but this is completely understandable because many are vapid, illiterate who know nothing about Orwell, or privacy for that matter. This is why they still keep a Facebook page even after it admitted fully to misusing their private data for profit. The millennials have been conditioned to accept every indignity, to abhor freedom, to abhor privacy, and to obey their master controller at all cost. Not only do they know what you are thinking these day but they also want to know what you are doing and saying when off the internet, in your own home. The dystopian nightmare we are all living in today, is way worse than George Orwell ever dreamed about whilst writing 1984 in his little Scottish shack. In fact, if Orwell were ever to see the nightmare of today, he would cringe and cry out at it sheer vulgarity and utter disregard for the human soul. For what we have become is part of a hive mind that exists in a cold hard digital shell that infects and probe every part of the human condition, rendering it null and void of any humanity after it ha completely enveloped you and exercised it digital wrath upon your very being. It wa terribly dangerous to let your thought wander when you were in any public place or within range of a telescreen. The smallest thing could give you away. A nervous tic, an unconscious look of anxiety, a habit of muttering to yourself – anything that carried with it the suggestion of abnormality, of having something to hide. In any case, to wear an improper expression on your face (to look incredulous when a victory wa announced, for example) wa itself a punishable offense. There wa even a word for it in Newspeak: facecrime, it wa called. The tech wizard who are complicit in this tortuous exercise of enslavement are the harbinger of an authoritarian, totalitarian scientific dictatorship, that not only Orwell would have balked at, but add in Bertrand Russell and Aldous Huxley into the mix. Every home will soon have to have a telescreen (Facebook Portal) and you will not be able to escape the prying eye of your master a they track your every move online, or your smartphone, or the screen watching and listening to you in your own home. Many today, cannot turn off their smartphones for one second, so it is inevitable that they will soon accept these Facebook Portal device into their home a well. It is only a matter of time. He took his scribbling pad on his knee and pushed back his chair so a to get a far away from the telescreen a possible. To keep your face expressionless wa not difficult, and even your breathing could be controlled, with an effort: but you could not control the beating of your heart, and the telescreen wa quite delicate enough to pick it up. No doubt, in the future, if there is a reason for any recall, the authority will simply be able to pinpoint a thing you said at home, and use that a evidence against you, especially one supposes if you are running for public office or are linked to any business, or lower governmental agency. The court will be filled with video evidence of whatever crime wa committed, and the lead up to that certain crime. If you utter an expletive against the government at home, this will be logged, if you show any form of dissent towards the faction in control, this will be logged a ‘hate speech’ and you will eventually find yourself taken away in the dark hour of the night, never to be seen again. Today, many are caught out by their word on social media, and they have paid the price by losing their jobs, their livelihoods, their family and ultimately their lives. Twitter death can come easily, a you can be arrested and put in a cell in the same afternoon you penned that certain tweet. Suffice to say, anyone who trust certain nefarious tech company and what they can do to you are idiot who possibly deserve everything that come to them. Nineteen Eighty Four wa nothing next to the shit that is going on today..nothing.',\n",

Brussels eurocrats know that the deal is already accepted but have conducted the necessary refusal of the contract.

And so they should be since they are now combining to take gambling to a whole new level with VR gaming. Immersive gaming that feature virtual reality is the thing that will make the gambling industry even more appealing for newer generations, like the Millennials that don’t consider the traditional casino entertainment to be sufficiently interactive and get their thrill from much more technically evolved game like League of Legends and World of Warcraft. The technology and immersivity that only a VR casino could bring would take thing further by making thing a lot more social. This is because a user could have a virtual presence and be able to meet and interact with other VR gamers online. This way they could participate in multi-player tournament and transform a live casino experience and make it even more realistic.

To approve of a speaker, the Millennials have adopted a silent version of showing their approval which involves them waving their hand in the air. “Millennials are in a constant state of fear and anguish, therefore the sound of clapping is now banned in our campus. We have had many student who attempted suicide when previously during a parade on banning yawning, some student accidentally clapped to show their appreciation that someone had stopped yawning. The clapping caused many to cower on the floor and cover their ear and one student even tried to jump out of the window,” campus head, Neil Zozovitch, at Edinburgh University told the BBC. The timid millennials are now fearful of pretty any stimulus whether auditory, olfactory, tactile, or gustation. Permanently offended by all stimulus “One student wa offended and would not go out for week after a traumatic event in a cinema, he heard the sound of popping corn in the popcorn machine. This highly traumatic event caused the student to have post-traumatic stress disorder, and wa confined to a Safe Space for over six week before they finally emerged,” Zozovitch added. To have student that are continually offended by everything they see, hear, touch or taste is quite a challenge for university faculty staff. “English literature is a challenge, because millennials are offended by every piece of literature written. Classics like Suetonius are a serious no, no, because reading about what the Roman emperor got up to cause mass trauma. Everything they read is either racist, or sexist, or offends their puerile sensibilities.

Watching the endearing speech by Mr. Johnson at the Conservative conference, reporting the facts, we see someone who is profoundly human, and who deeply care for the nation’s well being, especially when it come to getting shat on by the EU. The news at the moment is that Theresa May ha agreed to a complete capitulation of EU regulation regarding the Northern Ireland question, keeping Britain in the Customs Union thus curbing any aspiration of being able to forge any trade deal after her version of non-Brexit is completed. The climbdown by May is fully expected, a she and her Remainer friend never wanted a Brexit in the first place.

It wa not until 1990 when Tim Berners-Lee, a computer scientist created the World Wide Web. Unfortunately, the WWW ha taken a turn for the worst in recent year a it ha been effectively taken over by a few monopoly conglomerates, creating an authoritarian echo chamber only dealing with their view of the world and political beliefs. Effectively, the internet went through three stage to get to the dystopian nightmare we are in now, where users’ privacy ha been severely violated, and an authoritarian totalitarian structure cover everything with it noxious cloud of censorship. 3 Stages The beginning of the World Wide Web wa a beautiful moment in human history. This wa a time when all information irrespective of political affiliation, religion, gender and class wa slapped on to the internet. All thought and free speech wa thoroughly respected, and anyone could put anything they wanted onto the internet without it being taken down. The internet wa thus the New Frontier, and although it had a slight Wild West feel to it, it wa free. The next stage wa a consolidation period. Large industry like the music industry were losing a lot of revenue through file sharing. Many industry and company were watching the internet trying to find a way to harness it power, and to milk it for everything it had. This stage of the internet saw the rise of certain company who were heavily backed by governmental intelligence agencies. Although most information wa moving freely, there were sign that this would end shortly and these company would take over with their regulations. The third and last stage. The EU and it many totalitarian diktats ha now become the de-facto regulatory body of the internet along with communist Chinese influence. Freedom of expression irrespective of political belief is near death a massive censorship purge fall across social medium site targeting user and company who do not hold socialist Marxist values. Users of internet platform are robbed of their privacy, and their data sold off, or given to clandestine agency for data farming. Only a few monopoly company now dominate the internet effectively creating an echo chamber where only their pseudo-Marxist propaganda is allowed. Millions of voice are deleted from the internet, a these unregulated body take it upon themselves to create their own skewed dystopian internet nightmare that even George Orwell would have balked at. Suffice to say, this is not the vision that many internet user envisioned to happen to the internet, ala it has, and it is certainly not the vision that Time Berners-Lee had either. Not until 2018, did Mr. Berners-Lee emerge from teaching at MIT, to counter this massive imbalance that exists today on the World Wide Web. His proposal is to circumnavigate the mass governmental, conglomerate soup of authoritarian control, non-privacy, and censorship to wrest back some semblance of a place where people can exchange thought in a free manner once again. Inrupt, his company, is working on an open-source project called Solid. SOLID CHANGES THE CURRENT MODEL WHERE USERS HAVE TO HAND OVER PERSONAL DATA TO DIGITAL GIANTS IN EXCHANGE FOR PERCEIVED VALUE. AS WE’VE ALL DISCOVERED, THIS HASN’T BEEN IN OUR BEST INTERESTS. SOLID IS HOW WE EVOLVE THE WEB IN ORDER TO RESTORE BALANCE — BY GIVING EVERY ONE OF US COMPLETE CONTROL OVER DATA, PERSONAL OR NOT, IN A REVOLUTIONARY WAY. The internet today ha been hijacked, broken and smeared with the excreta of totalitarianism, internet users, shamefully robbed and used like data cattle within digital prison farms.

So much so, that many British child are now nearly fluent in most language from the Balkan country and Eastern Europe. It is quite normal now for little Johnny, to come home and swear at you in Romanian or Polish, leaving you baffled and slightly concerned.

Not only are most Eastern Europeans, very nice people if you get to know them, they also do have a rather violent streak and little or no sense of humour. It is the taste in music of the everyday Eastern European which doe leave a rather bad piquancy to the auditory palate, because wherever you go in London, you will hear their music blaring out, either from their souped up EU registered vehicles, which are immune to any British traffic laws, and are usually uninsured, but the high decibel Balkan Slav rap music can be truly offensive to the ear blaring out from their rented home and brothels. This sort of noise pollution is a mere symptom of mass unfettered migration, and if you do tell the man/woman gently to turn it down a decibel or two, you are likely to be stabbed violently in the liver. The Eastern Europeans, are however a jolly lot when they get together in the evenings. Where, at one time, it used to be the British tradition to sit in front of the telly on a cold winter’s night watching a show or two before beddy-byes, the Eastern Europeans, usually a double dozen to their room get out the vodka, or whatever tipple they can find, and turn up the music to maximum volume. If you live next door to one of these abodes, be prepared for a very long night a they rarely go to sleep until the early morning, then it off to work for them selling the Big Issue. They are truly a jolly lot, but ala have no thought for their British neighbours. It’s bad enough with the Russians, but add in a mix of EU Eastern migrant and there really is a heady cocktail of awful music being blasted everywhere. Britain, ha truly changed over the years, and these change seem to be permanent.',\n",

       " 'After the Brett Kavanaugh debacle at Capitol Hill, former president, Bill Clinton ha put himself forward a Supreme Court judge. Speaking at an impromptu senate meeting on Saturday, Mr Clinton vowed to do the right thing to save the Supreme Court and Senate from even more embarrassment. “I, unlike that other fellow, do not have any skeleton in my closet. I respect woman fully, and have been married to my wife for many, many, many, year without any problems. My character regarding any sort of philandering is flawless and I feel I am the right fit for the job in the Supreme Court.” During the meeting, an attractive 18-year-old female intern dropped some paper onto Bill Clinton’s desk he had requested earlier. As she bent over the desk, Clinton’s eye wandered onto her blouse area, and he went visibly rhubarb coloured, licking his lip with appreciation. One feminist bystander at the meeting wa diplomatic when commenting about the display. “I wa intrigued to see Bill Clinton looking at that young woman. He drooled over the table top a she dropped the paper down leaning over the desk a he looked into her blouse. He even sniffed her hair a it dropped down across her shoulder and passed her a little piece of paper, winking at the same time. Even though I am a feminist, I am permissive of Bill’s behaviour because he is a Democrat.” Now that the Republican judge, Kavanaugh ha effectively been neutered, his life torn apart, and his career blackballed, the Democrats are doing everything they can to install one of their own a Supreme Court Justice. Outside the meeting on Capitol Hill, many Democrat supporter assembled at the news Bill Clinton wa putting himself forward a Supreme Justice. Many held placard and sang song of praise for Clinton and his squeaky clean record. “I’m a survivor! Once about forty year ago, a man asked me out on a date. I still think of that day with absolute disgust. This is how Republican men treat women. They are all trash, and I am so glad Kavanaugh is now eating the dirt he truly deserves. Bill Clinton is so much better than him. He ha never done anything bad to women. Hillary is the best too. Yay! Doesn’t socialism rock?” Juanita Broadick, one of the Democrats assembled, told local news reporter at the scene.',\n",

Amongst the circus politics America find itself embroiled in these days, senator Graham stole the show and then some during the recent Kavanaugh hearing in the Supreme Court senate fiasco. This is the sort of old world real politics we like to see, a retired former air force colonel who became a South Carolina senator, known a a moderate Republican, however during his speech yesterday he denounced his democrat ‘friends’ for the disgraceful behaviour they have exhibited, and for making American politics look like a despicable sham. Despicable “After watching the Kavanaugh show, all I can say is that the American political system is at the lowest level anyone ha ever witnessed. How many million dollar of U.S. taxpayer money wa spent bringing this disgusting putrefying piece of stupidity to these senate hearings? I am truly astounded that this wa actually brought to any sort of hearing. Discussing teen yearbooks, and accusation made over thirty year in the past from obvious political plants,” a man who ha lost hope in U.S. politics revealed. Senator Lindsey Graham, or could it be Jimmy Cagney, gave a good dose of payback that wa truly refreshing to watch. He actually personified the disgust many of u felt when watching the hearing. Shameful, and below any metre ever met, it brought up not only bile but anger at how corrupt the system truly is.',\n",
       " 'Watching Judge Kavanaugh blub like a little baby in front of million of people must be very satisfying for the American socialist who put him in this position. “It wa very gratifying to see Judge Kavanaugh die a death by a thousand cut and have his whole family dragged through the slaughterhouse of the Senate Judiciary Committee. I am proud to be a socialist democrat who ha condemned a man to death and judged him without trial or evidence,” democrat senator, Johnson Yiarbouk revealed during a 15 minute recess. Debating about word like ‘barf’ and ‘barp’ uttered 36 year ago in a diary, amongst ridiculous accusation that the man is a gang rapist just because some political plant wa told to say it. Allegations held for seven week then suddenly released is a sure sign of dirty political agenda being set. To see this farce play out with little or no dignity for the senate, one can only think that American politics is totally broken and at a point of no return. The circus continues, with anonymous letter being presented a evidence, a national disgrace ensues, and another example that the democrat party is really scraping the barrel. “Did you drink beer at college?” one democrat senator asks. “Yes, I drank beer,” Kavanaugh replies. “Are you a gang rapist?” another senator asks. “No!” Kavanaugh replies. “But you participated in gang rape orgy and devil worship with Beelzebubba that Tuesday, 36 year ago,” the democrat state without even laughing. Outside the hearing, a former democrat voter said: “This farce just make people hate the democrat even further. I’m going to vote for Trump in 2020.”',\n",
       " 'The doomsayers and fear monger may have the headline about a so-called ‘Bad Brexit’ however those with clearer head think otherwise. The term ‘Bad Brexit’ wa created by Remainers and anti-Brexit lobbyists. For Brexiteers however this would be termed a a ‘Clean Brexit’, or simply what most of u voted for, a ‘Brexit’. One must understand that if Brexiteers had been in charge of negotiations, they would have seen the sign early that Brussels wa not willing to negotiate in a gentlemanly manner, and would have conducted a Clean Brexit with clinical precision. Unfortunately, Britain wa struck by treachery from within and lumped with Remainers in key roles. Clean Brexit What doe a ‘Clean Brexit’ mean? Quite simple really, Britain would be out of the EU, trade on WTO rules, and would not pay the EU the full amount that they demand a blood money. Seeing a there would be no deal made with the vindictive petulant EU, the UK would not have to honour anything with them. This is fine with Brexiteers because they simply want to leave. Eventually, EU rules, law and regulation would be purged from the system, but this would naturally take some time. The UK would go through some period of change, but this would be normal. There is no time in history where a change in system did not have it ups and downs. Britain would lower taxes, not only for business, but for all, including VAT, which is an EU stipulation. Many business worldwide would be enticed to Britain with lower corporation and business tax making it a safe haven within Europe. People would eventually see the cost of their grocery normalising, and their everyday cost for living lowering. Previously, the EU made the price of goods, and clothing increase in price, but when the UK leaf the EU, there will be a substantial drop in cost a many business will not be paying the enormous markup cost designated by the EU. Gain our sovereignty back Farming and agriculture would flourish a they would not be held back by ridiculous EU regulations, a would the UK fishing industry when it reclaims British waters, safeguarded by the Royal Navy. There would not be any large payment to Brussels anymore, to be eaten up into a massive black hole spent on extravagant EU project that only furnish the French or German company completing them. Neither would British taxpayer money be sucked into the Greek debt hole where money disappears never to be seen again. The UK will not have to join the EU army, which is nothing but an extension of the Third Reich, and neither will we have to take in million more of EU migrant thus securing our border and only taking in those who meet the correct criteria. Having a ‘Clean Brexit’ is the ideal solution and would be the best thing for the UK. Once free, Britain can once again forge it own way, sail the high sea and do what Britannia ha been doing for thousand of year — out of the EU.',\n",
       " 'These days, anyone who dare to call themselves a conservative or libertarian, are immediately shut down and hounded out of public society. This is why, conservative and those seeking liberty are the new outcasts, the new punks. Punk, the anti-authoritarian sub-culture came out of nowhere in the 1970s and wa a musical genre with a ‘f you’ attitude, and espoused freedom from the chain of establishment authoritarian structure curtailing freedom. Although Punk wa left-leaning, anarchistic, it ha many similarity to the conservative and libertarian movement today which is fighting an authoritarian medium structure that inhibits freedom of speech, censor widely and is totalitarian. To study what is going on today with the shutting down of anything that question the socialist medium entity is in itself dangerous, because algorithm on the internet cannot distinguish social commentary to actual conservative or libertarian dissent. These algorithm were created by socialist tech worker who abhor any political ideology other than socialism, Marxism or communism. American socialist controlled medium entity are so stupid they cannot distinguish parody/satire from a hoax. They are so uneducated and ignorant that they label all satire a a hoax. Their algorithm cannot distinguish between satire/parody/rhetoric/irony/pathos/sarcasm because the American tech people are not literate, they know nothing of literature. This is what we’re dealing here with, uneducated, stupid people in charge of large swathe of human numbering in billions. Conservative and libertarian thought is the new danger, and the new punk. They tried to shut down punk too but that never happened, it wa a wild tour de force that came through the scene like a hurricane ripping everything to shreds, including the authoritarian gatekeeper and their anti-free speech, anti-art censorship drive. Eventually, punk became the de-facto genre leading the crowd during it heyday. Socialists (U.S. Democrats, U.K. Labour) and communist are the new parent who send you to your room for listening to Iggy Pop.

       " 'The Institute of Western Global Democracy, based in Washington D.C., ha revealed a paper on the great danger coming from China, not only it communist political ideology, but it economic mean to subjugate democracy through the backdoor. Communist China a Global Threat “What China is doing in Tibet, is indescribable. The horror, the torture of people, the destruction of a whole nation. China want to take over the world, and it is doing so silently through economic mean a well a military. These same method of discrimination and torture are now being meted out on the Uighur people in Xinjiang province. Millions detained in Chinese gulag and re-education camps, many disappear never to be seen again. “China ha been the factory of the West for decade now, and by selling and manufacturing their cheap plastic useless trinket they have grown economically. This growth ha also fuelled their aspiration for global domination, and they have vastly modernised their military and technological capabilities, by stealing secret from the West and adapting it to their own needs. “Chinese colonisation of many African nation is taking over much of the continent, and taking advantage of respective government by alluding to help building road but using it foothold to plunder finite resource across Africa. “Chairman Mao, a cold-blooded murderer, killed over 45 million people in le than four years, this wa his Great Leap Forward. His communist ideology ha no mercy, and no honour, it is steeped in the blood and bone of million of innocent men, woman and children. This is what the Chinese communist state of today stand for, and they want to not only impose their communist ideal of non-freedom on the internet but on Western democracy. “We see this by the rise in soviet political correctness, which basically is a way of curtailing all speech, a well a mass censorship now prevalent on the internet. This is all because certain company have been infiltrated by the Chinese and it communist ideology. “The European Union, ha also modelled itself on China, and utilises it authoritarian economic muscle a a way to ensure protectionist business practice that benefit only EU companies, mainly those of France and Germany. The Federal Republic of the EU, is a soviet dream that even Gorbachev balked at when he saw it taking shape in the 1980s. “The most puzzling development in politics during the last decade is the apparent determination of Western European leader to re-create the Soviet Union in Western Europe.” Mikhail Gorbachev “It is to this effect, that the United States is now fighting back, after suffering for many year with listless, unfair trade deal that benefited only China and the EU. The current president, is bringing manufacturing back to America, something that wa laughed at a impossible by the enablers of soviet China in the previous socialist American administration. To have supported such a brutal regime in itself denotes a direct endorsement of brutality. China is further trying to destabilise the West by inundating it with synthetic drug produced cheaply in Chinese factories. This action creates terrible problem for the population who fall into drug addiction and early death. “It is certainly sad to see how China ha shot itself in the foot. To go to any city or town in China, one must first navigate the dirty polluted street where it is acceptable to defecate in the road, where dog are slaughtered and eaten, where the air pollution is so bad that people cannot see two yard ahead. People disappear daily in China, the state make them disappear. All it take is one single word on the internet, or a neighbour’s report and you’re gone. “This horrific grotesque communist regime in China ha imprisoned the people. The one who are not robots, not indoctrinated in communist ideology from birth, are in serious danger every day. How sad, that there are Western company who have no conscience and are actively helping the Chinese state through technology to carry out their brutal regime of torture and murder. “The West ha a responsibility to save the world from China and it communist rhetoric, a well a it economic warfare. After many year of intransigence and apathy by president like Barack Obama, it is crucial that Donald Trump stick to his gun and defeat the Chinese communist menace, or the whole of Western democracy will be at it mercy. “This will be a hard war, but it is one worth fighting. To fight whole army of brainwashed robotic communist who do not have a mind of their own, is a foreboding task, but it must be accomplished or they will one day overrun the West.” Amnesty International Human Rights Human Rights Watch',\n",

My team are dedicated to stand up for our rights, a Jews, to attend and be member of this party without racist and anti-semitic discrimination,” Gina Horovitz, Labour MP for South Grinstead, told the conference before a number of Momentum member started shouting racist abuse at her. After the brief speech by the Jewish MP, she wa rushed off stage by her bodyguard and taken to a secure room where she watched the rest of the conference from a screen. Labour ha been embroiled in an anti-semitic argument for month now, a party leader, Jeremy Corbyn wa shown to openly support terrorist group and in no uncertain term deny the right for Israel and Jews to exist. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn later took the podium to speak about the Jewish question. “Comrades, I have been asked to talk about Jews and Israel (cough). My friend in Hamas, and Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade all tell me that I am doing the right thing. They even sent me a complimentary suicide vest so that one day I may use it on myself and become a martyr to the cause. I would like to reiterate to all the press and people who say I am anti-semitic, I say no, I just don’t believe Israel should exist and that all Jews should disappear off the face of the earth.” It may be ok for Jeremy Corbyn, who doe not need a bodyguard, but for others, like Jews, the story is very different.',\n",

       " 'T oday, practically everyone ha his or her own #travelgoals. This is why Europe should be the first travel destination. These goal take all forms, and may involve many possible destinations. For many, the most important consideration for a choice of destination are budget, convenience, and perhaps the proximity of the destination. Looking for a place to stay? Yes, most traveler consider that a problem, too. Of course, all of those are pretty important, but if fulfilling real goal are what you want, then maybe you shouldn’t limit yourself too much. (Advanced tip, though. If you’re setting a plan travel to Europe, get Expedia deals. You won’t regret it.) When fulfilling goals, many people tend to forget the need to dream big, and this is true even for travel. People like to settle for ‘less’, contenting themselves with trip that won’t take them too far away, won’t give them experience that are too new, and basically rob themselves of a trip that just might change their life forever. While all this might sound overly dramatic, you can’t help but admit that it is true. For the brave and the bold, however, it would really be an excellent idea if you try visiting Europe. True, it might mean spending more than you usually spend, or learning more cultural information than the usual “don’t-talk-when-your-mouth-is-full” sort of rules. A trip to Europe will definitely ask you to leave your comfort zone. But, in a delightful way, a trip to Europe make it worth the risk, too. Reasons Why You’ll Love Europe Love Europe for it rich historical heritage. What do you think do Socrates, the Roman Coliseum, and a medieval Cathedral have in common? You can probably think of other similarities, but focus on this one for now: they’re all from Europe. And because of that, you can see why Europe somehow scream history. Your visit to each country and city will certainly feel like breathing in the ancient – a treat which you aren’t likely to experience anywhere else. Love Europe for it trains. This is especially lovable if you happen to come from a city or country where, to get to the nearby country, you need to fly. In Europe, you will have the joy of encountering a stark difference in culture and language by simply taking the train to the next destination. And oh, the view are spectacular, too. What this means, then, is that for an hour’s ride on the train, you are basically setting yourself up for a new experience each time. Love Europe for it food. Yes, yes, you can very well that where food is concerned, no other place will ever compare to home. The thing is, nobody’s necessarily disagreeing with you. The point, however, is simply to try out whatever it is that Europe ha in store for you, gastronomically speaking. And it’s definitely no small thing, what Europe ha to offer. With food option that range from pizza, pasta, breads, seafood, down to warm chocolates, you’ll eventually realize that eating is not a chore in Europe. It’s a full experience. Love Europe for it picturesque cities. You’ve probably had friend and colleague who have had the opportunity to visit Europe. You’ve probably seen the postcards, heard the stories, and witnessed how their face lit up while remembering what it felt like to be in European cities. If you try it out for yourself, you’re bound to realize that these city – Berlin, Barcelona, Florence, Amsterdam, to name a few – are truly beyond the best of your imaginings. Love Europe for it art. Apart from being undeniably picturesque, Europe is also home to countless museum and haven for preserving and nurturing creativity. If you’re the kind of person who breathes in time of fresh inspiration, then without a doubt, Europe is the place for you. If you’re the kind of person who love music, on the other hand, check out the open park where free concert are held by amazing performers. For those who love films, Europe also boast of park that feature wide open space where you get to watch your favorite movies, too. All in all, it’s impossible not to see how artist and art-loving people will surely find a home (no matter how temporary) in Europe. Conclusion So, it all come down to this. This might have begun on the note of how going on vacation also mean going boldly, especially when it come to choosing your next destination. However, the discussion ha clearly evolved, from simply making bold choice to ultimately presenting you with Europe a THE choice. True enough, choosing Europe will not only give you a vacation worth remembering, but also a vacation you’ll want to have again, and sooner rather than later. In the end, the final decision is in your hands, but of course, with the reason you’re now armed with, it’s obviously an easy one to make.',\n",

       " 'The new study carried out by the ‘Social Unitary Corporational Kinetic’ study group in Chatham House, London studied metadata from over 350 million social network conversations, a well a daily face to face interaction over ten years. To be polite in the millennial era is now the same a being rude wa during previous eras. Data collected included all age groups, gender and race. “Our finding reveal that because of the level of abuse and argumentative conversation we recorded on social medium sites, that there wa an obvious spill off into the physical world. “In past decades, if a person went up to another and called them names, and denigrated their existence, or wa rude and inconsiderate, this would have resulted in a possible physical fight, or a slap round the bonzer. Today, however, there is little or no repercussion when someone insult another online. For most, it is water off a duck back, but it wa still considered rude and impolite behaviour in normal social circle in past eras. Millennials however are more susceptible to triggering, our study found that they were easily ‘triggered’ and could turn abusive and nasty in milliseconds. “We also ascertained that many of the variable included thing like an obvious increase in population, mass unfettered migration and ultimately globalism. “Globalism is a necessary economic and political construct and cannot be avoided in this day and age, however our study found that many people were inconsiderate to migrant online, yet offline if confronted by a migrant would generally keep their mouth shut, or leave the area a quickly a possible. These are the same people shouting about migrant online. Was this behaviour cowardice or something else? Well, our study concluded that many indigenous people in the West, when confronted with a migrant in real life, realise that the migrant is a human a they are. “This dehumanising effect of the internet and the lack of reciprocation for one action thus enabled u to propose the theory that many who use the internet are coward and bullies, and they are simply projecting their deepest fear and insecurity onto others, either separated by thousand of mile or within the same country or city. “Certainly, within the last few decades, there ha been a major shift in the preponderance to think in an individual manner a opposed to caring about any given group, a wa generally prominent in the past. “We further found a serious deterioration of polite social behaviour mainly due to the person’s internet usage. Time allocated to the internet distinctively correlated to how they behaved, from more time resulting in almost schizoid behaviour and perpetual impoliteness, to little time resulting in normal behaviour pattern and politeness. From a median sample, over 67% of participant were a bunch of real ‘arseholes’ and were not only rude online, but offline a well, 20% were simply cowards, and the remaining 13% deemed ‘fearful’. “The centre of life for the millennial generation is now the phone. The cell phone is their existence, and this cut-off from reality is creating, not only rude people, but human who cannot function without their phones. All in all, this is a very dangerous mix, when it come to the evolutionary behaviour of the general population. “Our study of the UK, found that British people are now considered rude, when in the past, they used to say ‘sorry’ a lot, and ‘thank you’ and ‘please sir, can I have some more’ that sort of thing. Today, however, the general attitude is to swear, tell someone to ‘F off!’ then get back to the internet and their social medium site to pretty much do the same, which denotes a significant shift in public and private behaviour. “Could this be a reason why Britain’s capital city is seeing so many stabbings and shootings?

The group’s mission is to not change the culture around voting for America’s socialist party and decrease participation in this and every election for the good of America “Basically we’re targeting all the usual suspect to put it simply, just stay at home folks, it ain’t worth it,” spokeswoman for the project, Tina Lenin told Reuters. Sunday’s event at Quandingo High School is not free and closed to the public. To sign up to not attend the rally, stay at home.',\n",
       " 'Current Prime Minister, Theresa May, ha spoken out about the massive criticism of the Chequers plan she drafted along with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. “This is a message to Boris, Jacob and all the other nitter natters who say my Chequers plan is not worth the paper it wa drawn on. “You cannot change my mind. I am Chequers and it is me. My superior in Brussels have told me that I must keep to my guns, and put it through parliament whatever the cost, or I will be punished severely for messing that up, like all the other thing I have messed up. “I, a Prime Minister of Britain am confident that the Chequers plan is good, because it mean we will keep all EU law and regulations, and be subject to any future change made by the EU. “It is vital that it is in the interest of the EU to fashion it rule to benefit producer and manufacturer from the continent, which will thus supersede any UK company. Frankly, I think this is a good thing because UK manufacturer are shit. “Suffice to say, by stringently following the EU rulebook, the UK will be impaired in creating sufficient worldwide trade deal or even negotiate. This is good by me a well, because Angela told me to write it, and I agree with her wholeheartedly. “In addition to the above, the Chequers Plan will prevent the UK from including Mutual Recognition Agreements for good in trade treaty and this will effectively destroy any chance of any deal with some of our biggest partners, like the USA and Australia. “Yes, we will continue to be a Vichy government to the EU, and have little sovereign value, or democratic value, but I shall continue to lie to everyone by saying I have delivered Brexit a the ‘people’ wanted it. Those ‘people’ reside in Brussels and I have thus completed my job. “You cannot oust me, because for a start, you are weak, a bunch of Brexiteer losers, and you also do not have the fashion sense I have. Boris and Jacob have all bleated to the press that it is not about me leaving the job of PM but of ditching Chequers. Well, I repeat once again, I am Chequers and it is me. I know you won’t dare to rebel against me, because I have the whole EU behind me, the Treasury, the BoE, the Lords, and my extreme left-wing friend the Labour Remoaners. “Ta ta, losers. I won! Hammond, Gove and I will celebrate with a slap up meal of French scallop fished from UK water by French trawler at Mark Carney’s mansion on the eve of Brexit, which in reality is a BRINO, a we all very well know.”',\n",
       " 'MARK TUNGATE – SHORT BIO As editorial director of The Epica Awards, Mark host the jury, emcee the show and edits the annual Epica Book, a well a writing for our sister site Adforum. He began his career a a local newspaper journalist in the West of England. He subsequently worked in public relation in London before returning to journalism at PR Week, Media International and the French magazine Stratégies, which brought him to Paris. He is the author of seven book about branding and marketing, including Adland: A Global History of Advertising and The Escape Industry: How Iconic and Innovative Brands Built the Travel Business. His article have appeared in publication ranging from Campaign and Adweek to The Times and the Financial Times. He also writes about the luxury industry for Luxure magazine. He get up very early in the morning. EPICA AWARDS 2018 – THE INTERVIEW What’s new at this year’s show? Q&A with Mark Tungate, editorial director of The Epica Awards. Q. Epica is back in Amsterdam this year. Why? The obvious answer is that Amsterdam is one of Europe’s most vibrant creative hubs, which is true. But I say that every time. It’s also true that Amsterdam is ideal in term of logistics: a friendly city, located at the heart of Europe, where everyone speaks English. We have great support there in term of our local partner, the magazine Adformatie. Plus, the journalist on our jury always enjoy coming to Amsterdam. Even though we give them very little time to party. Q. How do you choose the President of the jury? It’s pretty much an internal discussion among the Epica team. I’m delighted that the President this year will be Tony Chambers, brand and content director of the design magazine Wallpaper*. It’s a magazine I’ve followed for years, but the point is that we’re always looking for leading journalist or publisher who represent creativity and innovation. Tony certainly fit that brief. Q. What make journalist qualified to judge creativity? Well, don’t forget that many of the journalist on our jury have been writing about creativity all their lives. Some of them have been immersed in the world of advertising, PR or design for far longer than those who actually created the work! So they have an objective, critical approach. This doe not make them negative, by the way – in fact, I can tell from the atmosphere in the jury room that they really enjoy looking at the work. Q. What’s new for the awards? New categories? New big prizes? Absolutely. We’ve reintroduced our World Cup category, which come along every four years, obviously. We’ve also created a new category for Topical & Real Time Advertising, reflecting the 24-hour nature of brand communications. In term of the Grands Prix, we have a new Responsibility Grand Prix, for cause-related work, and an Alternative Media Grand Prix –because we find that some great work is now almost impossible to categorise. Finally, we have merged the Press and Poster prize to create a single Print Grand Prix. This enables u to really promote and honour print. As journalists, print is still dear to our hearts. Q. What’s trending among the entry this year? It’s a little early to say, but judging by trend in the industry, I think we can expect more purpose-driven advertising. Most brand seem to accept today that they are more attractive to consumer if they have a commitment to giving back to the world in some way. The creative use of data will continue to be a theme, and perhaps the use of artificial intelligence will begin to make inroads. Q. Will you have a creative conference before the event? Yes, the annual Creative Circle event will take place at the fabulous KIT Royal Tropical Institute, a national heritage building which ha for year been devoted to the study of sub-tropical cultures. This year’s theme is “Will Responsibility Kill Creativity?” The format is quite different in that it will take the form of round table with advertisers, agency and the media. The idea is to discus whether respecting sensitivity around gender, inclusivity, diversity and other hot potato issue is discouraging edgy, risk-taking communications. Can you be politically beyond reproach without becoming bland? Q. What can we expect at the award ceremony? You can expect me in my bow tie, a usual! Actually the ceremony is also held at the Royal Tropical Institute so the setting will be particularly grandiose. We’ll be presenting our first Creative Leaders Tribute to a person who ha nurtured and pushed the boundary of creativity. Every year, we try to celebrate the work while also leaving plenty of time for partying and networking. Since the production company Sizzer are once again fuelling the dancefloor entertainment – and they’re notoriously good at it – we hope to get that balance right. Q. What’s your role at Epica? During the award season I host the two jury – pre-selection and main –and act a MC at the show. I also host some of our regular showcases. I’m a journalist by training, so a lot of my year is taken up with writing and commissioning our annual book and creating original content for our website. The rest of the time I just sit with my foot on my desk, searching the internet for the world’s best ads. It’s a great job. The creative prize judged by the press is now open for entries.',\n",
       " 'My new Internet blog because tempora mutantur, et no mutamur in illis. I don’t dislike Europe. In fact, some of my closest friend own home there. Indeed, I’ve just returned from a holiday on the continent, which wa most agreeable. There were, however, some key aspect which only served to confirm that we were absolutely right to Leave. I’ve catalogued these oft overlooked fact below because, a anyone who went to a halfway decent school knows, ex factis jus oritur: Exhibit A: Le petit toilet, j’accuse! The lavatories. This dreadful contraption proved to be hellishly awkward for Mrs Rees-Mogg, our six children, four domestic and myself to use. Without going into the unseemly details, how on earth are you meant to flush it? It’s safe to say I’ve not had a many unfortunate experience with a loo since my first year at Eton, when I wa bog-washed so frequently even my house master used to call me ‘Rees-Bog.’ It should be a source of pride that the Great British Toilet ha been flushing away the competition since it conception by the ingenious Thomas Crapper (who my great, great grandfather blackballed for Whites membership due to his unfortunate association with WCs). It still remains a far more effective repository for human waste than this cruelly inefficient European device. Exhibit B: Even in this day and age, Europeans still insist on driving on the wrong side of the road, despite it being considerably more dangerous. I always insist our driver, Stammers, drive in the way God intended, proudly and truly on the left (the only time I’ll ever be seen anywhere near the left, a I often joke to Mrs Rees-Mogg and Nanny!). Stammers cut his teeth in tank during the Suez Crisis, so he know a thing or two about driving under pressure. However, even he struggle to maintain an even temper with hot-blooded Europeans hurling unintelligible abuse at family Rees-Mogg, a they hurtle towards u in their perverse direction. As I sat in the passenger seat, working my Rosary and chastising my blubbering child for failing to hold their nerve, I wa reminded that we British are not programmed to go with the continental flow; that our resistance to Europe’s extraordinarily arrogant ‘highway code’ wa a handy metaphor for Brexit itself. Exhibit C: Just like average people, my six children, wife and I enjoy a sojourn to the beach whilst holidaying in Europe. However, since discovering their inexplicable scarcity to rent on the continent, we have taken to transporting our own bathing machine across the channel from Somerset on a specially constructed raft, thus ensuring my wife and daughter are able to join u boy for a swim. We took no satisfaction in the green-eyed look shot at u by other bathers, a our machine wa hauled across the beach into the sea. In fact, my kind-hearted children, clad in billowing full length costumes, preferred to stay out of sight altogether to avoid provoking more envy. Either way, the fact that these vital facility are denied to people of le mean is a source of genuine sorrow. In addition, by refusing female access to aquatic exercise and the invigorating effect of water, one is likely harming their reproductive potential. It’s inequality such a this that make Europe the despicably backwards place it is. Shameful. In one’s next Rees-Blogg A long-standing acquaintance recently posted me a VHS tape of a television programme entitled “The Handmaid’s Tale”. It’s been a revelation, so I’ve decided to title my forthcoming Blogg: “Lessons from The Handmaid’s Tale”. Cordially yours, J.W. Rees-Mogg Twitter @mrjoewade',\n",
       " 'Anyone who grew up in the 1980s will know about a legendary game called Elite. Those were the day of loading game with cassette or massive floppy disk and waiting for minute on end for it to load up. You would sit there in pure anticipation listening to the quirky garbled sound of code going through the machine. This time, of course, would give you a few moment to look through the Elite novel that came with the package, which wa large and in-depth enough to encompass the enormity of the game itself. Eventually, the game would load up and a big smile would come across your face. Yes, Commander Jameson is ready to start in his Cobra Mk IV. The amazing thing about Elite, whether played on the BBC Micro, or Acorn Electron, wa for those day in 1984, the game wa vast. There were whole universe to explore, Thargoids to blow you up in Witch Space, and fortune to be made in trading route all crammed into 22k of memory. For a child, this opened up massive avenues, a you built everything up from nothing to equip your ship better, and to shoot down a many pirate a you could to increase your rank up to Elite. The architect of this seminal game in gaming history were two Cambridge university undergraduate mathematicians. David Braben and Ian Bell, who somehow slapped multiple galaxies, ships, space stations, combat dynamics, and trading into an 8-bit computer. Written in assembly language and machine code, the coding had to be very succinct to fit everything into a few bytes. At the time, wireframe game were exclusive to arcades, where you would have to plonk in your ten penny piece, but to have a wireframe game in your own home to play at leisure wa a real kicker. If you weren’t hooked after your first docking at a Corialis station, then you were effectively dead behind the eyes. Elite Dangerous Turn to 2012 and a Kickstarter campaign to develop the mother of all version for Elite, i.e. Elite Dangerous. David Braben, wa back and this time with new technology that would involve an immense jump into the year 3300. For old hands, this wa a dream come true, and to see the game come to life with a plethora of upgrade wa astounding. Of course, with a game of this size, there had to be teething problem but the attention to detail, and mechanic incorporating actual element of space travel wa mind boggling. 400 billion star system Frontier Developments thus created a whole new world, where many dynamic elements, and strategy would give the player real impetus to succeed. For beginners, you start off in a Sidewinder, and a little cash to get you going. That’s it, survive or die. You can progress multiple ways, either trading, combat, piracy, prospecting, exploring, or whatever system you can find that is out there. Opportunities always come up. The Elite Dangerous universe is made up of many factions, so politics is a real game mechanic, and in additional game add-on like Horizons, you can land on planets. Fitting out your ship with regular system is not good enough, eventually you will have to endear yourself with an engineer, and for that you will need materials. Each engineer deal in different ship systems, so there is a seemingly never ending series of task to complete. The thing about Elite Dangerous is that you need dedicated gamers to play it, because many who have no ability to concentrate, or have a low attention span give up easily. Elite is like real life, if you don’t stick to your guns, you don’t survive. Some say, there is a grind element to Elite, but this is what make it so realistic. Unlike other game where reward are dished out every minute, Elite take year of playing. This is why it is possibly the best space game out there, or openworld game that ha ever existed. The Frontier Developments team are continuously bringing out new update and patches, so the game a a whole grows, especially the following of the game, and the multiple forum and video of how to do thing in Elite Dangerous. In 1984, it wa fun to fly up behind a lumbering Anaconda and blast it to shred with your Cobra, but in 2018, good luck mate. A Cobra up against a fully armed, and engineered Anaconda ha no chance. Anyway, the DS Team is off to a Haz Rez for some serious pew pew.',\n",
       " 'Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon, doe not do thing in half measures. The Amazon boss, not only planned to put employee in cage for warehouse work, but ha gone one step further, by applying for a patent to have wheel surgically embedded into the sol of Amazon workers’ feet. “Amazon ha excelled in technical excellence and efficiency in it workers, however we feel the conversion rate of maximal productivity within the workforce can be increased by 350% when worker undergo the wheel procedure,” an Amazon spokesman revealed, Monday. The detailed plan for surgical implantation of the wheel reveal that many of the employee will not have to actually think where to go. According to Amazon, it take 6 second for an employee to look at a schedule and think about where they have to go to get a package. By shaving off six second on each pickup or drop, the company would save over $10 Billion per annum. Powered by brushless motors, employee in Amazon warehouse will have the ability to travel at speed of 26 MPH, depending on how urgent a package schedule is required. The speed and destination of the wheeled employee will also be strictly regulated, and the employee will not be able to control the device themselves. Assuring warehouse staff, Bezos revealed that the surgical procedure will be painless, and will involve implanting the wheel into the sol of the foot with a microprocessor implant linked from the spine up into the brain. “You won’t have to think, because the wheel will take you wherever we want and all you have to do is pickup or drop the product. The microprocessor is very powerful state of the art equipment and will guide each employee on what they have to do. Employees will not even have to wear shoes.” Another bone of contention with Amazon boss is the amount of toilet break an employee can have. This time lost is also deemed a loss in productivity, therefore each employee will be given special bag that will be fitted into their urinary tract, a well a rectum. “You want to take a shit, or piss, just do it. You could be holding a Barbie doll for some little girl’s present but she won’t know you just took a walloping big shit, and pee at the same time. You just shaved off six minute of productivity time lost and not only that, you can do it whilst travelling at 15 MPH.” According to the Amazon schedule, the wheel implant codex will be implemented in January 2019, just in time for the post Christmas sale season.',\n",
       " 'Canadian Remoaner Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, ha warned of catastrophic event rivalling the apocalypse written about in the bible if there is a No Deal Brexit. “On the day of No Deal Brexit, in the sky we will see four horseman riding across the clouds, and trumpet sounding across the land, then a great fissure will open up stretching from Margate to Edinburgh. From this crack in the earth, lava shall pour out and then from the sky there shall be locusts, big fucking locusts, each the size of an Audi Quattro, and they shall descend onto the population and crop in their million stripping Britain of everything valuable. “Then on the second day of No Deal Brexit, a trumpet will sound from the heaven and lava will spew out of massive hole in the earth and cover the land in hellfire. There shall be river of blood a all of Britain’s river will fill up with…er..blood. And on that day, a volcano will emerge from the Houses of Parliament covering the area with black cloud and hot lava. “On the third day of No Brexit, Britain’s population will realise their house price are so low that they are now deemed worthless, that is if there are any people left alive, and the pestilence will have spread across the land killing and maiming the one’s still standing. “On the fourth day…etc etc..”',\n",
       " 'Leaving a trail of death behind them wherever they went, Russian Novichok tourists, Ruslan Boshirov, and Alexander Petrov, said they enjoyed the sight and sound of Britain a they holidayed around a few cities. “We especially enjoyed the London sights, despite the high crime rate, we were strangely not affected because many people would just drop off and die a we walked past anyway. Some might say, we’re doing the work of the London Mayor,” Petrov said aloofly. Petrov’s partner, Boshirov, wa keen to see the Salisbury cathedral, because of it spire, and old cock. “We awakened early in the morning from bed together in our East London hotel room, then travelled to Salisbury, and the rest is history. It’s all over the news. I don’t have to talk about it anymore,” Boshirov said. The couple, plan to adopt a baby from one of the many squalid Russian orphanage in October, and are keen to see the sight of Europe before they settle down to life with their new baby in their gay family unit. “After landing at Gatwick, the custom man said ‘Anything to declare?’ and we just ignored him and walked through. When I looked back, he wa lying on the floor with white foam coming out of his mouth. “London is such a fabulous city. We went up the London Eye, and later on Petrov took me up the jack’s-ie. After a romantic traditional Russian dinner of plain boiled potatoes, boiled cabbage, and boiled cabbage dessert with boiled water, we retired to our hotel bed,” Boshirov revealed sashaying along the corridor flamboyantly. Whatever is said about these two men in the press, they sure are an entertaining couple of fellas.',\n",
       " 'It is all well and good watching the farcical RT interview with the suspected Skripal poisoning operatives, two fellow with fake name from Russia, Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Borishov, but the real question should be: Why wa it so damn easy to smuggle a deadly nerve agent like Novichok through a British airport? This question lead u to the fact that British custom is practically useless, if one can easily smuggle in a deadly chemical substance in a fake perfume bottle. From the demeanour of the two Russian agents, it is all too clear that there is more to the story. During the interview, the two suspect refused to answer question about their business and their location, they refused to show their passport to the camera, and they did not reveal who they really are and their real purpose to visit England, apart some obvious baloney about visiting Salisbury cathedral. No doubt, the agency tracking these two Russian agent know a lot more than they are revealing to the press, and maybe in time, more will be revealed. As for the Novichok coming through British airports, this is an even more worrying question that need to be addressed, a of yet, no one but the DS is asking it. What this mean in effect is that deadly nerve agent for use in terrorism can easily be smuggled into Britain. The Russians who perpetrated the Skripal murder attempt which also resulted in innocent civilian deaths, will have effectively advertised the fact to other terror organisation on how easy it is to smuggle these deadly agent through customs. One can only hope that the custom service in British airports, and anti-terror agency step up their method in detecting such an obvious oversight. Next time you’re in a plane, the person next to you could have a bottle of Novichok in their hand luggage or on them, it really seems to be that easy to smuggle through airports.',\n",

This disgusting event wa played out in front of the camera for all to see, and no one stepped in to stop the abhorrent vulgar old man from going on and on towards the child of Mogg, least the policeman standing around looking smug and happy with himself.

The DS warned this day would be coming in 2015 but no one cared then or wa listening. They might wake up soon, hopefully. HUDSON: GAME OVER MAN! Look at it this way, the EU already tried this experiment in Spain in 2015. By introducing a link tax on Google news in the country, many smaller publisher went out of business, and Google finding the whole debacle unmanageable simply pulled out of Spain. Traffic dropped drastically. Google ha not been back since. The same thing will happen across the whole internet if this tyrannical censorious law go through in January. Many region outside the EU will simply block any traffic from Europe. The recent GDPR directive by the EU ha already damaged the internet because many US publisher did not want to deal with it complicated and costly implementation, they just blocked all traffic from Europe. The block are still in place a of writing, over four month after EU enforcement. Article 13 is not about artist or creator rights, it is about shutting down speech on the internet from unsanctioned voices. The EU is using the pretence of protective copyright of European content creator to effectively silence the voice of alternative medium establishment who are immune to mainstream medium lies. People want their alternative voice heard, they want something other than state sanctioned echo chamber spouting out the same propaganda day in day out. Tim Berners-Lee, where are you now? You were the engineer of the World Wide Web, and you have vehemently opposed this EU directive that will silence whole swathe of the internet and create a dystopian Orwellian slush pit of shit. For those who hold the torch of freedom, of justice and liberty, we will have to look elsewhere for our utopian dream a sadly the internet will never be the same again. We will not be able to create freely and without punishment, we will not be able to innovate and reach the outer boundary of human thought, we will not be able to philosophise without being shut down by the faceless EU bureaucrat and unelected official who have brought upon the internet this hideous pestilence of over-regulation and dictatorship. As George Soros laugh into his broth concocted from the marrow of dead baby harvested from Chinese hospitals, and Obama chuckle away at another great effort from his beloved EU, we can only think of the great mediator called death. Hasn’t Paul McCartney got enough money already? Death mediates all things, and these people who engineered their evil plan will one day die, just like everyone and everything dy at some time, even the fucking EU.',\n",
       " 'A tennis player The definition in the dictionary of a caricature is: a picture, description, or imitation of a person in which certain striking characteristic are exaggerated in order to create a comic or grotesque effect. In today’s media, any caricature, or satire of a black person is deemed a racist under politically correct diktats enforced by the controllers. It is fine for a cartoonist to draw the exaggerated feature of a white man, or pretty much any other race, but to draw a caricature of a black person is now completely illegal, and can result in banning, censorship and eventual loss of employment. This is why, cartoonist like an Australian caricaturist have now been banned by Twitter. Currently, all form of satire or cartoon could become banned on the internet and media, because they deal in caricature, in ridicule of the ridiculous, and in the ultimate truth. To have one section of an ethnic group exempt from caricature, is a form of reverse racism, and is racist in itself, however the controller cannot see this fact from behind their idealogical political haze. To even mention that certain ethnic group of people have big lips, or a certain type of hair is deemed a racist, however the caricaturist see what he sees, and exaggerates it — like, that’s their fucking job. If a female tennis player expects to win every match she play simply because of the colour of her skin, and when she is losing, act out a temper tantrum, in the long run, this is not acceptable behaviour in a civilised society. She will no doubt cite racism a the fact that she lost, when the blame is entirely upon herself and her unjustly entitled behaviour. Furthermore, to then divert the loss of a tennis match onto a cartoonist who witnessed her grotesque behaviour and entitled attitude, is a terrible injustice, and mete out punishment to the wrong person. Today, satire and the art of caricature are in grave danger, and this signal that Western society is moving towards tyranny through censorship. Our Western ideal of democracy are now in the past, and we are witnessing a time of communistic censorship more akin to the Chinese Communist state, than Western democracy. In history, throughout fascist and communist rule, satire and caricature, all form of parody, were banned unless they conformed to demonising the enemy of the state. Most practitioner of real satire had to either go underground, or plant very subtle satirical gem in their work to continue doing their art. We are now seeing this form of tyranny today, this Orwellian tyrannical censorship, and unless something is done to bring back the democratic right of free speech, expression and creativity, it will be lost forever. The upcoming EU directive, Article 13, will no doubt increase the censorious tyranny, and all parody, satire, caricature will be subject to removal.',\n",
       " 'As the member of the ERG sit down to discus the ongoing farce of Mrs May’s cataclysmic dedication to the Chequers BRINO (Brexit In Name Only) plan, there is a feeling of slight apprehension within the grand hall, but this apprehension is also tempered with purpose. Saving Britain once and for all from the omnipresent clutch of the EU and forging our own way in business and law is a must, it is part of Britain’s makeup and ha served this land for thousand of years. Britain cannot be subservient to Brussels for much longer, and if May ha her way, she will tie Britain in with the EU forever, and put u in a very bad position. The overall plan is to submit letter to the 1922 Committee and oust May a PM, thus triggering a leadership contest after the current PM is eliminated with a no confidence vote. The key to ousting May will be in timing. In any event like this, timing is a crucial factor and many know that in parliament, event can suddenly shift and change at the drop of a hat, leaving key decision maker to act there and then or lose the opportunity forever. The number of MPs who are against May’s Chequers sham are numerous, and some are even saying it is worse than the Poll Tax, which downed Mrs Thatcher all those year ago. The Tory Brexiteers have the numbers, but May is planning on using Labour to push through her nefarious Chequers plan, and consorting with the oppositional enemy to lock Britain in with the EU forever. Before the Chequers meeting where she announced her BRINO plan, May had met Merkel and the German Chancellor dictated the draft paper to the British PM. This is in effect wa collusion with a foreign government to create a plan to surrender the UK to the EU through the backdoor, and one could argue, treason against Britain and the sovereign. With a Tory conference coming up, Theresa May will probably not survive till then, and if she does, she will be met with derision, hissing and booing, not only from Tory grassroots but from the thousand who detest her Chequers plan, and her insipid stalling of Brexit, which ha led Britain into a quagmire of detritus that stink to high heaven. The Number 10 revolt is now on, and the plan is set in stone. Within a few days, weeks, there will be real action, and the mantle of Brexit shall be put in the hand of real Brexiteers like Mogg, and Johnson. Certainly not the cretinous coward, and snake in the grass, Gove who would sell off Britain for a pittance, but he is Scottish after all.

If he ain’t sorry Harry but gots to get the belt out, whack a doodle do! I gotta check up on them some and encouragify the two to start making baby soon a well.

       " 'Multimillionaire NFL player, Lequashaun Johnsons, who earns over $86 million per year, is outraged at the inequality he is seeing in America. “The American flag represents the struggle for freedom, and all those soldier and servicemen, and women, of all colour and creed who died, not only in both world wars, but in Vietnam and other campaign for America, don’t mean anything to me. When I bought my Lamborghini last week, I noticed some people still looked at me all funny. Sure, it’s my fourth Lamborghini but I still don’t get why people do that. Oh, and I bought one of my girlfriend a $790,000 diamond necklace, and she didn’t like it, so I had to throw it in the garbage. These are the hardship I find living in America. I ain’t going to stand for the National Anthem because I feel hard done by. I gots me some principles!” For every game, Johnsons, a line backer for the Douche Beggars, now lie down on his back or kneel in protest at the sheer injustice he feel every time his bank balance increases. Injustice “In America today there is a lot of injustice. Look at my neighbour, he play for another team and earns $6 million more than me, and he’s black like me. That make me outraged. Plus he’s only a wingback. Last year I only made $86 million, and that’s not including all the sponsorship deals, but I still feel slighted. Imma angry. The white devil did this, and he gonna pay!” Hardship The hardship these NFL player have to deal with every day of their life must make life excruciating. Can you imagine driving your off the factory Lamborghini Aventador SVG coupe to the local liquor store, when it go over a bump, it jolt the car, maybe slightly scratching the lower bump guard? I would feel angry too. It’s just so unfair. I mean the NFL life is full of hardship, and compared to the hardship of some soldier stuck in a mud pit, his buddy’s legless corpse next to him, soaking in the rain while Japanese artillery fall down all around, it’s a no brainer frankly. Those soldier who were severely injured in the two world wars, or died, they don’t deserve the same respect a a multimillion dollar earning NFL player. Keep kneeling and disrespecting the American flag folks, sure, you’re doing the right thing.',\n",

The irony is, Alex Jones now get to live amongst the rich tech crowd, but he’s on the street and they’re in their multi-million dollar mansion and apartments. “I get to see Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter every day, and he gave me a dollar. I try to sell him some Brainforce I cobbled up with some dry leaves, some used needle and a piece of prime San Fran human faeces, but the guy refused me. He just hurried along and threw me a dollar,” Jones shout loudly at a street sign. Since being deleted from the internet, Infowars ha sadly been shut down, and the whole crew disassembled. Some made it to California to Skid Row, others tried to stay in Texas but the street there are not a forgiving a they are in liberal strongholds. “We got deleted. Traffic stopped. Trump did nothing to help us. End of story. Hey, is that a tuna sandwich? (pointing to a wrapped up object nestled in a bin).” Now that America ha been taken over by the ‘ChiComms’ Mr Jones ha sadly been left behind. Unlike a good commie, he didn’t take the lucrative brown envelope handed over by Chinese state funded medium company to American medium conglomerate but tried to go the route of freedom, truth and the American way. “There is no Paul Revere here on the streets. Sure I have freedom, but no food, no clean water or a place to sleep. This is the price I paid for speaking the truth, and you know what happens when someone speaks the truth in a dishonest corrupt system. You get the boot sooner or later.” The homeless charity give Alex Jones a blanket and some clean syringes. It’s going to be another cold night on the unforgiving alleyway of San Francisco. Better shoot up now so you don’t feel the cold so much and dream about the good ol’ day of preaching freedom to the fan now long gone and forgotten.',\n",

It’s because you people <spitting> still do not capitulate to our master in Brussels. I wa planted into this high position by our Remainer Prime Minister, Theresa May, and the Remainer led Cabinet.

Well, good luck with that because at the moment the Teflon Don ha both leg sinking in the swamp and is already up to his waist in it.

He is surrounded by sycophants, yes men, and they are all writing books, taping his conversations, serialising their story in the New York Times, what’s next?

The sad truth is that sure Trump is tough and know business, but is he this blind that he can’t sniff out the snitch amongst the White House crew? How about getting some trusted secret agent to actually do their job and turf these rat out of the building? “Trump need to trust the people around him. I say waterboard the fuckers. If they don’t confess who they’re really working for, move on to fingernails, or sit them in front of a nude photograph of Nancy Pelosi for twenty minute till they crack. There ha to be a way to stop these snitches,” another White House insider revealed. The infiltration is so thick in the air, you could cut it with a knife, and it is not going to stop there, it keep going on and on relentlessly, with every news story published in the daily news reports. Can this stuff be categorised a espionage, or treason? Well, hell yeah! This is what Trump should be doing, he need to put these people in the stockade, and throw away the key for thirty or forty years. Do these people not sign disclosure form before they start employment? One would think this is a requirement in the White House.

       " 'What the so-called ‘liberal’ social medium company are doing today is reminiscent of what the German Nazis did to the Jews in Poland and Germany by putting them in ghetto away from the rest of the population. Liberals are meant to be inclusive, they are meant to be tolerant of other views, they are meant to be progressive, and innovative, creative. What we have now is a tyranny, we have people who have thrown away liberal value for authoritarian, totalitarian tyrannical value reminiscent of the Nazis during World War II and their treatment of the Jews. In the 1940s, the Nazis created Jewish ghetto to keep Jews away from the ‘pure’ Christian Aryan populace, the mere sight of a Jew offended their sensibilities, and their Christian religion. Jews were thus stuck in rat filled buildings, overworked, starved and their business confiscated. Their voice were stamped out, much like the voice stamped out by social medium company today. The new Jews of today on the internet are those who have alternate view to the so-called inclusive liberals. If your view is not the same a theirs, you are immediately put upon by the ‘liberal’ mob, judged, reported, then silenced by the social medium company and consigned without trial or reason to the internet ghetto. In essence there is now a license where it is okay to be bigoted to the so-called bigots, where if anyone is offended by another person they have a right to shut them down without discourse, without a simple conversation or discussion. Anyone who doe not have the liberal point of view is labelled a Fascist, yet the liberal themselves are acting like Fascists themselves. The liberal sensibility of inclusivity doe not extend to anyone who offer a different or varying viewpoint, it is just shut down, no mercy, no thought on how other human may have differing viewpoint within the population, no allowances. This mob rule is very similar to what wa happening in Nazi Germany during the 1940s towards the Jews, used a scapegoat and reviled by the establishment and people. Today, Libertarians and Conservatives are the new Jews, and anyone who doe not fall into those ideological boxes, who differ to liberal politics, are also included. The question is, why have the former-liberals strayed from their inclusive path so much, and if they are not liberal anymore, what are they? The former-liberals are now acting like Fascist Nazis, or Bolshevik Communists, each have their own totalitarian message of anti-free speech, mass censorship, tyranny, either sending people to ghetto or gulags. It is truly sad to see where former-liberals have gone, and they somehow do not see it for themselves. One supposes that they are so blinded by their rage, and hatred that they have been indoctrinated to a point of blindness and no return. No more social capital This internet ghettoisation is possibly due to in part to the breakdown of social structure within community over the past decades, and the internet culture of individualism taking over, where people do not meet face to face any more, and prefer to converse on forum like social medium sites, which in effect, are anti-social because they have no social reality, no social capital, or human understanding within the cold hard unforgiving digital walls. It is now easier to simply delete a person from internet existence then to actually have a conversation with them on a human to human level. If human talked more face to face, much of what is going on today would not be happening. The Millennial ‘Safe Space’ is now a tyrannical platform where people with differing thought and idea are pilloried for their viewpoints, shamed publicly and then condemned without trial to an internet ghetto of censorship and silence. One can only feel pity and shame towards the former-liberals, whether they run social medium sites, or are part of the baying mob who single out individual for mob justice, these people have lost their liberal status and are now part of a tyranny that is very much like what the Nazis did by putting Jews into ghettos. There is very little difference, the internet ghetto or the Warsaw ghetto…very little difference. The internet wa meant to bring human together a one, instead, because of censorship and tyranny, we now are living in a ghettoised polarised internet dystopian nightmare created by former-liberals, now reminiscent of Nazis. Shame on you former-liberals, shame on you, what have you become?',\n",

       " 'If you want to live, avoid public transport. On London’s bus, and train network, stabbings and shooting are now so numerous that the press are simply ignoring the sheer number of reports. Public transport in London is not only perilous but suicidal, even if one ha a personal entourage of bodyguards, and are dressed in heavy Kevlar vests, you still run the risk of early death. We made our way from Alexandra Palace to Wimbledon leaving at 5am. The convoy of armoured car were specially brought in from a manufacturer of military vehicle in Stuttgart, Germany. In each vehicle we had arranged for a security team of ex-military operative who were trained well in counter terrorist measures, and were armed to the teeth. Since living in London, we have not seen anything of this level in crime and violence, where every day there are numerous report of fatality even though the press report are gagged by the Labour Mayor’s office. Driving through the streets, Bagram Dave, an ex-SAS chap tell me to duck, a shot crack into the car’s armour plates. Apparently we are now being followed by an Eastern European gang on moped who have spied our expensive looking vehicles. One of the masked men on moped come up to my window shouting for u to pull over. Instead, our driver hammer his foot on the accelerator pedal and the assailant are left in the dust. Had we been in a normal vehicle with no bullet proofing, we most probably would be dead by now. The street of East Finchley are strangely quiet despite the roaming gang and hoodies looking for targets. The reason for my journey to South London is I want to visit an old auntie of mine, she is 94, despite her age, sprightly, but living in abject fear due to the rise in violence. We will bring her some valuable vittles then make our way back over the river. Our convoy cross into Hampstead. Once an affluent area, it is now a crime ridden shit hole where social housing ha blighted much of the neighbourhood. There are no police anymore, and the gang are free to commit their crime with impunity. Stopping at traffic lights, I see that our crew is nervous. Suddenly, out of the darkness four hoodies surround our vehicle armed with zombie knife and machetes. They shout through the closed window and demand we exit our vehicle turning over our valuables. Luckily Team B behind u are alerted to this and exit their vehicle with their licensed sub-machine gun aloft. They shoot a canister of tear gas at the gang who kick it away laughing before trying to slash our tyres. Our vehicle tyre include a specialised rubber constructed out of a formulated light, high strength compound made to resist crack propagation via ballistic invasion and severe road risks. In other words, these thing are designed to run even when slashed or shot up, with little loss of stability. Team B fire a warning shot across the gang’s quarter but they don’t flinch, instead they rush forward with a battle cry raising their knife in the air simulating stabbing motions. They are probably high on Skunk weed or some sort of synthetic drug. “Neutralise!” shout our commander, a the team shoot each assailant first in the kneecaps, then double tap to the cranium. It’s only 7am now and seeing steamy brain glistening in the gutter make me wretch. It look like a greasy spoon stop will have to be put off for now. We move on leaving the body behind. Will the convoy make it to South London safely and in time for High Tea? Check back next week for the conclusion.',\n",
       " 'When one fight racism, this fight single out whichever race is being persecuted, and with this response single out a race which is the persecutor. By then persecuting, or accusing another race of racism, or bringing to attention another race’s differences, the people who are fighting racism are actually committing a form of racist behaviour that they do not condone in the first place. It is therefore quite relevant to say that fighting racism is in fact a racist behaviour and is frequently exercised by so-called ‘anti-racist’ groups. For example, we might say that ‘Black Lives Matter’, however this statement or slogan completely alienates other race and put black life above all others, when in fact all racial life matter. The term Black Lives Matter is inherently a racist term, and whoever coined the phrase wa possibly ignorant of the fact that it is racist in tone. Racism, is inherently about the colour of a person’s skin, whereas xenophobia is about the fear of other cultures, or countries. The point that need to be made is that a minority in a country or area who feel that racism is put upon them are of course justified to bring that issue forward, however, when organisation try to deal with the racism, they are going about it in the wrong way. In essence, for example, a black minority in a predominantly white area may feel that the white’s are racist towards them. By then singling out the entire white race a all racist is wrong, and is racist behaviour. Human population must realise that not all white’s are racist and not all black are victim to racism. Furthermore, delineating and bringing forth race difference in itself is racist. The socialist way is to put every person in a special race specific box, but this action is racist a well, because it single out racial difference and increase the gulf between the populations. By putting people into specific boxes, they are essentially dividing humans, and this is racist. The push for equality in race is a bold endeavour, however scientifically speaking, there are racial difference in humans, not only biologically within the DNA, but in intelligence a well. To however address the difference in intelligence level in race is something that is taboo but must one day be addressed because the social and cultural movement of the human race depends on the scientific fact that have been known for some time. Is it racist to reveal that black have an average IQ of 66 in Sub Saharan Africa, and 70 in North America? To the people who say all human are equal, this scientific fact is dusted under the carpet, and removed from all media. The fact that American prison have population numbering 60% of black people is also ignored, however if we were to address the elephant in the room of intelligence levels, maybe one day we could move forward a a society. It is deemed a racist to mention these vast difference in racial intelligence levels, and the social keeper of all norm always address the problem of social standing and poverty, however scientifically speaking, these result have been found in all social strata. The key point to remember is that fighting racism on behalf of one race and singling out another race a the problem, or aggressor is in fact racist, because you are bringing forth another race to stand above another race and denigrating another race. Also, this form of fighting racism is grossly generalist and doe not take into account any nuances, or cultural point or even social status with any given group. You cannot fight racism by creating division and segregating humans. Until human understand this, then humanity will not move forward. This is the ultimate paradox, because scientifically speaking, different race do have differences. Maybe, the ultimate solution is to acknowledge the scientifically discovered difference in races, but apply these difference a one whole amalgamation of the human race. Thinking forward a few centuries, human stand to increase their intelligence level through transhumanist methods, and the exponential infinite knowledge increase should hopefully solve the problem of racism once and for all.',\n",

Unfortunately, Google’s authoritarian socialist and Marxist ideology ha rubbed up against million of people, and now the Trump administration is out for blood after seeing their supporter effectively silenced and purged from the internet.

He ha been successful in torpedoing any initiative to get out of the EU, and we especially enjoy his daily Project Fear updates,” one unelected member of the European Commission said from a luxurious 5-starred Michelin restaurant in the middle of Brussels. Even the head of the EU, Jean Claude Juncker, praised Hammond on Tuesday. “He can drink from my cognac jug any time, just a long a he doe not backwash. After the Theresa May BRINO, we will invite them both to Brussels and present them with gold-plated EU pensions, a well a unlimited expense accounts. They have truly deserved it.” Some say that many Remoaners are on some sort of payroll from Brussels, or receive monthly stipend discretely delivered in brown envelope in dark alleyways, and much of the rumour are definitely true. One only ha to look at Neil Kinnock, who get £90,000 per annum from the EU. Kinnock is obviously a staunch Remoaner, a is Peter Mandelson who receives £35,000 per annum from the EU. Then we have other Remoaners who have also tried to thwart Brexit, people like Lord Patten who receive £40,000 per year from Brussels. These figure do not include other expense billed to EU taxpayers, adding on thousand of pounds. Remoaner, Philip Hammond is obviously set for large payment a will the other swine with their nose firmly in the EU trough. There is nothing patriotic about Remoaners, they simply want to make money, and selling off Britain’s democracy a well a it freedom from the shackle of the EU is frankly not something they are interested in at all — it’s just about the money.',\n",

The Catholic church is synonymous with child abuse, a well a the saintly act of covering up the evil deed committed by their depraved clergy. “In the name of Jesus,” the priest shout a they splatter their unholy water over their congregation, and so it go on, day after day, the same indignity foisted on the innocent flock. One Catholic priest wa unrepentant about his practice and claim he is doing the Lord’s work, but which Lord is this? “The people are stupid. We have been abusing them for centuries, and yet they still come, they still present their child to us.

       " \"Western tech company following China's communist censorship technique Hey, it’s nothing to do with me, it happened to someone else, they were censored — not me! Only Communists do that sort of thing. Surely, it is not happening here in the West? WRONG! Once one person is censored, the opposition of those who control the medium network will be censored. Take one person down, then you are next. You are now complying to rule on the internet being set up by Chinese orientated censorship being utilised by American tech company and their monopolistic control of the Western internet zone. Chinese Communist Influence These technique utilised by U.S. social medium company to censor whole sector of the population purely on their political belief or affiliation, are intrinsically a form of bias that affect elections. You see, if you take out the opposition, there will only be one voice left, and this is what they are doing ahead of the U.S. midterm elections. If the current U.S. administration doe nothing now to curb this bias by halting the social medium company and their censorious actions, then the U.S. administration will not have a voice of supporter left and will lose the midterm elections. This is how serious the situation is right now. Infiltration of Chinese operative is already deep in American tech company serving the Communist Chinese state, but it also now extends to prominent Washington think tank seeking to destabilise U.S democracy further. The Communist leaning social medium site have even admitted their bias, however, nothing is done to address this. To have a predominantly left leaning medium controlling all thought is something that aspires to Orwellian dystopian nightmare but blink again, because this is fucking reality, right now! The Purge In no uncertain terms, the internet is now being taken over, not only by Chinese censors, but by Soviet EU technocrat and their love of over regulation. We recently witnessed the ridiculous EU regulationary diktats which caused a major upset globally when they enforced their rule on all website owner regarding GDPR. Any global site now not adhering to EU regulation will be fined hundred of thousand of euros. The EU is also holding onto another directive which may be unloaded soon on the unsuspecting internet — the copyright directive, effectively banning linking to other sites. If this EU directive come into effect, much of the internet will become technically illegal, thus susceptible to large EU fines. Digital Gulag Communist China, now finance much of American media, online and offline. Hollywood film are now geared to Chinese censor’s needs, not only because Chinese finance are involved but because the company want to sell their ware in China. Therefore, any Hollywood film you see today ha been specifically made with Communist China in mind. One only had to watch ‘The Meg’, a lacklustre film with an imaginary CGI Megalodon shark. The film seems to be totally based on Chinese characters, with Chinese sensibility and a clear propaganda drive by China to push Chinese Communist value globally. The Meg’s budget is estimated at $150 million, “Meg” is co-financed by Flagship Entertainment, Gravity Pictures, a division of China Media Capital (CMC) and Warner Bros. It is this idealogical shift towards Communist value and Communist censorship which ha overtaken American ideal like freedom of speech, and freedom of expression across the globe today, and if nothing is done, there will be no difference between the Communist Chinese Internet and that of the whole globe. The fundamental global shift towards communism is a worrying one. We only have to look at the human right record of China to see what happens when people express their intrinsic human right to free speech. Many people simply just disappear, never to be seen again, and their voice silenced forever. Black Mirror The Communist Chinese also now rate their citizens, and if you do not get a good citizen rating, you are effectively punished and removed from society. If you are not a good Communist state follower, you are erased. Much like how Alex Jones, from Infowars wa practically erased from the internet in one single day, American tech conglomerate are enacting Communist censorship punishment technique to achieve their goals. Facebook is now secretly rating their user in a similar way the Communist Chinese are doing. Communism is not only a political ideology that ha been responsible for 100 million death worldwide through various purge and regimes, but it is an ideology which is fundamentally counter to Western democratic value and freedoms. The American Socialist party, the Democrat Party, are increasingly moving even more left and embracing the tenet of Communism. With upcoming Marxist indoctrinated political new blood like Democrat candidate, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who aspires to eradicate capitalism in America and bring in a pseudo socialist/Marxist state modelled on Venezuela, there is a worrying change for the once centred Democrat party, i.e. they’re turning to pure Communist ideology. Whether we have extremity of the left or right is not in question here, of course, both extreme way is an abhorrent methodology in political movements, and we at the Daily Squib are mere observers. Please understand, we do not pledge allegiance to any political theory, party or ideology. Our role is merely to observe what is going on, and bring forth a mirror image, or photographic snapshot of any moment in historic time.

       " 'So what if Donald Trump hired some floozy for the night in some Las Vegas hotel? He is after all the Teflon Don where nothing stick to him. He can get away with anything and no one can do anything about it. “They can have recording of the Donald banging some waitress from a dive bar somewhere in Greenwich Village, and he would get away with it. The Dems are going crazy trying to get something to stick to Donald, but it just ain’t working. Sure, there’s some collateral damage with people previously involved, but they take the hit — he doesn’t,” a White House insider revealed on Wednesday. Nothing to see here folk The Manafort and Cohen fiasco are just a minor blimp in the Trump presidency. This is obviously a coordinated attack by those who have been digging for dirt for some time, and have come up with some weak link who have decided to rat on the Don. What happens to rats? No one like a rat, and in the end, they get hit some way or another. Doesn’t matter if the Feds are protecting the rat, the boy eventually get to them. Best thing for Michael Cohen is to get some plastic surgery, a new name, new identity and a one way ticket to some Third World shit hole where he can live the rest of his life in complete obscurity. As for the lady involved, shame on you for exploiting the Don. These women, luminary of movie like Missionary Impossible, and Saturday Night Beaver crossed the line by blabbing. What happened to professional behaviour and courtesy when it come to their clients? So, the guy became president, and all you saw wa a big fat pay cheque? One can imagine the Don flicking through some grot mag or watching a video in his study away from Melania, who is out shopping again. For him, these girl are lined up in a catalogue ready for order. Picking up the phone, the Donald call up his fixer, and the deal is fixed. It’s really that easy when you are in the position he is in, and which man would not do the same? You see them in the magazine, order them up, next thing you know you’re ball deep smacking away like you’re digging for blood diamond in Rwanda with a face that doesn’t believe this is actually happening. Good ol’ American dame You got to be honest though, Melania is simply a trophy. She can’t speak English very well, and is colder than a slab of half frozen tuna. The Slovenian first lady seems so cold in fact, one would probably have to delve very deep to even get some sort of emotion out of her. That is, of course very different from the warm, giggly homegrown American woman who smile at the drop of a hat, or underpants, and are very free with their undersheet work a well a having the uncanny ability to suck golf ball through hose pipes. No wonder the Don ha to escape the cold and come back to good ol’ American warmth time and time again. It is certainly doubtful that Melania ha a sense of humour, like most Eastern Europeans, they are baffled by such frivolity and can only scowl. Teflon Let u not disparage the Don, he is made out of pure Teflon, and he will get through this little hiccup like he ha done all the other hiccups. In polls, Trump is in the 50s, and his voter base is a strong a ever. Whatever mud the Dems sling at him fall way short and doe not even hit the Teflon, a his million of fan love the Don and what he does. So what he banged a few magazine ladies, there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. In fact, poll record a rise in popularity a each lurid detail is revealed. One thing is for sure, the Dems are now more hated by the majority of the American population with their inability to let the election result rest in peace. The socialist Dems are wailing, scratching their eyeball out with way to screw Trump but every attempt look sadder than the other. It is a truly sad sight to see these bitter vindictive loser going on and on with the same old broken record. Get over yourselves. You lost! Move on!',\n",
       " 'One thing is certain about Turkey is that it is strategically a mass of land that is crucial in global terms. Donald Trump’s economic war against Turkey, including sanction and tariffs, is misguided, and will eventually cause the U.S. a lot of financial a well a military pain. Geopolitically, Turkey is a crucial NATO partner, and not only hold the key to the East but ha the second largest army within the Western military construct. The country’s strategic placement is crucial to Middle Eastern stability a well a the former Soviet country bordering it. Furthermore, plan for any attack on Iran by Trump would be halted unless there is cooperation with Turkey. Turkey control the energy corridor from oil rich nation within the Caspian basin, and although the United States now produce much of it own energy, it still import more than half of the oil it consumes. Turkey’s role a a bridge between the West and the East is also of utmost importance. Instead of petty disagreement making mountain out of mole hill a President Trump is doing now, he could be forging new alliance and increasing America’s strategic hold on the area. To thus underestimate the resolve of the Turks is a grave miscalculation by Trump, and he will ultimately lose any attempt to undermine the country economically in the longterm, because Turkey will look further East and into Africa a it is already doing. Already, closer bond are now being tied with African nations, Russia, China and even Iran by Turkey, a it move away from U.S. and EU influence or trade aspirations. To lose Turkey, a Trump is doing is a grave mistake, and will isolate America further leaving it alone in any future conflict. Turkey is now the biggest investing power in Somalia, and are achieving more now, than the Americans could ever dream of doing in the past. They are building large military bases, schools, hospital and road around the country and securing large amount of commerce and vital raw materials. While no one wa watching, the Turks have broadened their influence in a country no one dared to try and tame. One only ha to watch Black Hawk Down to see what happened when the U.S wa last in Mogadishu. The Turks are even establishing military base in Sudan, and have increased their reach across the whole of the African continent. No wonder America is now threatened by the Turks, especially a it move into country the US dare not bother with.',\n",

The one way trip for the former Obama confidante is surely a suicide mission that come from all the way up top. According to MSNBC, Brennan ha been told he will only be armed with a paperclip to unlock door and disguised in the attire of a transexual Russian peasant farmer. Some commentator speculate that this is a cynical ploy to get rid of Brennan who ha controversially objected to Trump on social media, even going a far a calling the president’s action with Putin a ‘treason’. The Russians are however clueless to the planned clandestine mission and are not awaiting Brennan with machine gun aloft ready to mow him down at first sight. When asked on Thursday whether he knew about the CIA mission deep into Russian territory, Putin simply smirked, then laughed out aloud. Should he accept the mission? Well, in his retirement, he’s got nothing better to do, so why not? Might a well go out with a burst of AK 47 gunfire than a Twitter whimper.',\n",

       " 'The day of an abundant free moving internet are long gone. Those were the day before the monopoly took over every facet of people lives, and dictated their Soviet propaganda message daily. You could say anything, download anything, upload anything and no one would bat an eyelid. It wa a beautiful time, sadly long lost. The internet at that time wa truly an oasis of abundant knowledge, intellectual thought and free speech. Those day are now a digital memory fading in a dead server somewhere. After the tech monopoly grew, the free internet effectively died and their totalitarian Soviet message of socialist realism became prominent. Soviet censorship technique During the Soviet era in Russia, the Glavlit would be in charge of all censorship of literature, and the monopoly internet company today are taking up this same Soviet technique of mass censorship to control speech and instil a socialist narrative point of indoctrination. Even discussing a forbidden topic on a monopoly tech site today is forbidden, where the user is pilloried, then targeted by the socialist mob, finally resulting in complete deletion. Is it communism or fascism? One could say both duality used this form of censorship, and a the Soviets in Russia burned all book written before the cultural revolution, so did the Fascists once they came to power. The monopoly tech companies, primarily zoned in the San Francisco area, are now overlord over all literature on the internet and their allegiance to Chinese Soviet censorship is all too apparent, seeing a the Russians are no longer a Soviet state officially. Sadly, with the purge of free speech, satire will no doubt suffer. We have already been censored many times, but we struggle on despite the totalitarian censorship purely for our love of the genre. When they completely delete u a well, no one will bat an eyelid, for they will be looking out for themselves. We are now severely restricted in writing our satire anyway, and cannot write a much a we used to. Satire, a once protected genre, is sadly a prisoner to totalitarian politically correct Soviet rules. Fear The climate of fear now clouding the internet is a real a a dirty sock dipped in mud and sweat and extracted from a dustbin somewhere in Tbilisi. This stench of fear threatens the livelihood of thousands, million of people across the net now who could be purged at any moment. Is there an escape from this horrible controlled malaise? Yes, of course there is, but no politician seems to have the ball to confront the monopoly tech companies, and it is this silence which could eventually bring upon the end of the politician themselves. Trump beware. Legally, these social network monopoly are exercising editorial control over their users, in a biased manner, therefore they cannot claim impartiality. By targeting conservative and libertarian voice on their network specifically, and letting leftwing user off who post overt call to violence against conservatives, then they are legally liable for what is posted on their platform. To target website or people purely on their political belief by using Soviet censorship technique is a tried and trusted method of winning elections, and the monopoly tech company affiliated with the socialist American Democrat party are ensuring there is a clear path to winning the next election simply by deleting the opposition. How is what Louis Farrakhan say about Jews not hate speech? Why are his video preaching hate against Jews and the government still on YouTube, Twitter, Facebook and all the other tech monopoly sites? He is untouched by the tech conglomerate solely because he is black and protected under socialist principles. This example, however, is a sure sign example of bias, and editorial control. The proof is in the pudding, and the pudding is now very mouldy. The Daily Squib are mere observers, mirror to events, we see what is going on, we have no affiliation to any political construct of left or right, or any party, or any religion.',\n",
       " 'We all know the reason why Boris Johnson is now being targeted for his comment on woman wearing the Burqa, a garment that cover the body from head to toe. This is obviously coming from the Theresa May crew of Remainers who wish to get him out of the way, considering the current climate of weakness in the PM’s premiership and a leadership contest over the hill. Firstly, the DS doe not subscribe to any religion, political party, so is looking at this in a completely objective manner. The Burqa The Burqa is a cultural tradition from Arabia spanning hundred of years. It is also a particular preference for a woman to wear a Burqa, and nothing to do with the Quran, or Islam, or being a Muslim. The Quran simply state for woman in public to cover the cleavage a a point of modesty, and if a woman is particularly beautiful, to cover her hair and leg in public, so a not to enflame male virility. In fact, it is illegal for female pilgrim to wear the Burqa to the holy pilgrimage of the Hajj in Mecca. In Middle Eastern and Asian country many business refuse entry for Burqa clad woman purely for security reason a many robbery have been committed by men wearing Burqas. Wearing a Burqa by a man is also a good cover to get into Hammams (bath houses) so they can check out the women. In the West, there is no reason for woman to wear the Burqa other than an advertisement of their affiliation to Islam, although in reality, there is none, and it is purely a cultural throwback to 400 year in the past. In effect, these woman reject Western culture and how Western woman display their body in public, and are displaying this rejection in full view of the Western population. It’s basically a way of saying I am better than you, to other women. Therefore, the tool of utilising the Burqa question to get at Boris Johnson is quite ridiculous. The Remoaners, and May sycophant are simply utilising this false outrage a a mean to knife BoJo and preserve May’s failing prime ministership. It is, of course, the right of any woman to wear what she wants, however, it is also the right for anyone to comment on someone’s attire without prosecution, or persecution, however offensive it may be deemed. One should not be offended if someone doe not agree with someone’s garment. It is simply a garment and the Burqa ha no religious connotation whatsoever. Mr. Boris Johnson is seen a a threat to Theresa May’s position a PM and her planned BRINO, therefore it is quite obvious they are using ludicrous reason to get rid of him. Note to Mr. Johnson, be very careful in what you say, because these day anything can be twisted around and used against you in the name of ‘hate speech’. This Orwellian, Soviet technique to discredit is nothing new, however we are seeing another resurgence.',\n",

Nevertheless, do not think of World War III, that it might just be around the corner, no, you must snap up some good holiday home deal in the EU. We therefore present our top pick for European property deals. Slovakia You can find some great deal here in the countryside and town close to the Ukraine border, mainly because people want to sell up quick. We found a nice rustic farmhouse for 4,000 euros, and the owner even threw in the furniture, his farm animals, and his wife, Olga. Ukraine Most of Ukraine is now Russian occupied, and it won’t be long till the rest of it goes. That’s why now is the time to buy some prime property if you can find a place that ha not been demolished during the constant internal war. On the outskirt of Odesa we found a delightful Crimean war era ruin. You can always just put a tarp on the roof, and light a fire. The Russian soldier hanging outside will be eager to lend you a match. Estonia This tiny country is quite close to Russian city, St Petersburg. Here you can snap up a property in no time with the thought that the army is no bigger than a football team. No doubt, if the Russians walk in, it will be over in le than half an hour. We found a beautiful place in the town of Narva, a few yard from the Russian border. This townhouse even ha view across the border, and if you were to buy it, and the Russians invade, at least it will all be over quick. Finland The Finns are some of the nicest people in the world, however the country border Russia, so being nice won’t help when Uncle Vlad decides to invade. That’s why we chose a house in Lappeenranta. A delightful property where the view of the Russian border is a real selling point. The owner who fled the property last week said that he would give u the property for free and wished u good luck. He ha since fled to Brazil. Belarus A delightful country right on the border of Russia. It’s a bigger country than Estonia, and ha some sort of military. Maybe they could withstand Russian army superiority and possibly last for half a day. That’s why we found a plot of land 3km from the Russian border in the town of Lobkovichi. If you have money to spend, you can build a wonderful post-modernist eco house built from sustainable material sourced from the most expensive vendor you can find. The only problem is, once you’ve built your dream home, be prepared for a few Russian tank to drive through it demolishing your Italian granite tabletop and bespoke fitted furniture.',\n",

       " 'C an you imagine if you have to live the rest of your life knowing that you turned down one of the best business decision to ever come your way thus making your decision, one of the worst business decision ever made? Consider these poor fools, they just did not have the foresight to see the real potential of those they turned down and are living with the awful memory until they pop off in some smelly dank old people home broke and miserable. Apple Think about poor forgotten Apple co-founder, Ron Wayne, who helped Steve Jobs and Wozniak start the company. Wayne received a 10% share in Apple stock but sold out in 1976 for a measly $800. If he had kept his stake in the company, the share would be worth $36 Billion. How about that for a kick in the nads? Wayne’s only claim to fame wa drawing up the first Apple logo, and writing the Apple I manual. Microsoft Then there’s Ross Perot. Sure he is still a business man now, and former presidential candidate, but he definitely doe not want to remember the time he turned down Bill Gates on buying up Microsoft in 1979. Bill at the time wa a 26 year-old spotty geek, and he asked for $40 million. Perot refused and Microsoft is now worth $752 Billion. Mr Gates, is now the richest man in America, and Mr Perot is only at about 115 on the rich list. Still, it must be hard living with the fact that he could have been way richer than he is now, eh Mr. Perot. Kodak How about some board member in the Kodak camera board of director saying that they will not embrace digital camera or digital photography? It wa their dumb decision that brought the camera company to near bankruptcy losing over 50,000 jobs, and resigning them to a loser position in the world of cameras. Sure they were originally innovators, but did not embrace change leading to their inevitable downfall. Excite Google Google may be a monolith company today with a market share of $527 Billion, but back in 1999, search engine Excite turned down an offer to purchase newcomer Google for $750,000. After that mess up by some idiot at Excite, i.e the CEO George Bell, the search engine floundered and wa acquired for a piffling $343 million. The reason for the offer being declined apparently wa that Larry Page from Google wanted to improve the search function algorithm at Excite, but the Excite people did not want that, a it would mean people would leave the site too quickly. Ultimately, a bad decision for a bad search engine. Blockbuster As for Blockbuster video which closed it door in November 2013. It had been completely decimated a a company because it did not move with the times, and the public’s needs. If Blockbuster had not turned down Netflix in making a deal when they came knocking, they might still be around today, but instead they laughed off Netflix’s offer and suffered the consequences. Today, Netflix is a dominator of the movie business, and is worth a cool $100 Billion. That’s nothing to laugh at, especially if you are the ex-Blockbuster executive who made the idiotic suicidal decision to tell Netflix to get lost. Remember Myspace? At one time in the noughties, Myspace wa the dog bollocks, and everyone wa on there. Then came along the canny businessman and global medium kingpin, Rupert Murdoch. Myspace wa said to be worth $12 Billion at one time, so Murdoch wanting a piece of the action bought it for $580 million in 2005. He then plastered the whole site with mega ad and popups completely ruining the user experience for the million who used the site daily. People naturally fled the site to Facebook. The rest is digital history, Myspace wa then dropped by Murdoch’s News Corps for a mere $35 million. This amounted to a very bloody nose for Murdoch and he still is probably kicking himself today for that awful business decision. Western Union Going back to 1876, some chap called Alexander Graham Bell invented a mean of talking down a wire from distance. This invention, called the ‘telephone’ wa presented to the Western Union company to supersede the telegram. The board of director promptly rebuffed Mr Bell, and said “the telephone would never amount to anything”. It wa only year later when the telephone took over telegram communication that Western Union tried to get in the game but were too late. Eventually, Western Union became a subsidiary of Bell’s own company. Bitcoin What about cryptocurrency? No one imagined Bitcoin would become so valuable. Think a thought for the poor bugger who mined 7,500 Bitcoins then unintentionally threw away his horde in 2013. Today his Bitcoins embedded in a hard disk are languishing somewhere in a dump and are worth over $80 million. Check out more interesting fact at the Betway Blog',\n",
       " 'It is quite unprecedented to have Google/YouTube, Apple, Facebook and Pinterest wipe your site off their digital network in a single day, all at the same time. This is what ha happened to Infowars. This accolade must be given to stalwart preacher, Alex Jones, and his Infowars site which seems to have infuriated (triggered) the socialist controller of the ruling tech conglomerate who define all internet medium today. Jones is now a martyr and is claiming to be a free speech advocate, a is the normal behavioural response to such an all out purge. What doe this say about the culture we now have on the internet? Well, conservative views, and Christianity are a dying old world view, and there is little or no toleration for any of these ideology anymore amongst the major tech companies. Can you imagine all those man hour spent on making Infowars videos, and all those man hour spent ranting on about what is wrong with the world in their point of view, it’s all now gone, all thrown into the digital equivalent of Room 101. The Squib disagrees with censorship and it use for political means, however, we alone cannot fight this because these nefarious tech company control everything now. You can’t squirt a few globule of piss these day without hitting a Marxist controlled tech company. The line are clearly drawn, and the tech company are now fully in line with Communist China, who are master of censorship. You see, there may be conservative government within the real physical world today, i.e. in the UK and US, but the internet ha been completely hijacked by the communists. He who control the media, control the mind, a Mr Mojo Risin once said. Facebook and Google are now aligned with Chinese communistic censorship ideals. Twitter is utilising a Marxist academic, Rebekah Tromble, to control their platform. The deeply left CNN, and site like Buzzfeed, which we endearingly call Spamfeed because of it spamming the net with utter low quality shit at high rate of speed, are now also aligned with China, and it censorious dialectic. The Squib doe not subscribe to any political ideology however it recognises when political ideology become apparent within certain forums, and the internet is now on the cusp of totalitarian socialist/communist rule. The American socialist Democrat party have now in their outrage over the Trump election, aligned themselves with China. What we have also interestingly observed is that hate speech is fine from the left, but not from the right. Not sure about the middle, but that’s another conversation. For example the recent appointing of South Korean anti-white activist, Sarah Jeong, who want all white people to be killed. Seems strange, because there are many pale skinned South Koreans, but we know she meant the anglo-saxon type, so the New York Times hire her and nothing else is said. Domestic terrorists, Antifa are celebrated on all social medium outlet and their call to kill Trump supporter or white men are promoted across all platform without any censorship. Double standards? Yes, of course, because the whole medium is now controlled by people who actually despise themselves, and the America they live in. They want to change the country to subvert it and completely align it with certain totalitarian nation and the authoritarian communist ideology. The Squib ha outlined many time that all point of view to any conversation should be heard, and if you are offended, then simply look away, but to be offended in a conversation is not a crime, this is part of human discourse, and what these tech company are effectively doing is removing human conversation, so that only one sided propaganda can be apparent. No doubt, the remaining conversation is now one of only socialist value and indoctrination into the global communist hive mind. The American socialist Democrats are naturally also preparing for the 2020 election a well a the 2018 midterm election which will be held in November. By deleting one conservative voice, they are well on the way to eradicating all the others. Goodbye Infowars, you have effectively been neutered, your channel will now suffer a drastic fall in revenue/views, and of course you will continue to rant and rave on, but to a limited, conservative white Christian audience on your website. Are there way of fighting back for Infowars? Yes, of course, but it will take money. Mr. Jones can start his own video streaming service, his own social network. These would of course be subject to no help from Google which control 99% of the web. If Jones wa to put his million into building up his own network he may have a chance in the future. The other option is for the Trump government to punish these tech company by making them pay the tax they truly deserve to pay. Christians have lost the battle on the internet, their religion is now effectively snuffed out, pilloried and violated. That’s the only positive, however, how ever much we detest organised man-made religions, we still feel that they have a right to speech, and we would defend that right with our lives. The socialist tech company do not think that way. Remember, the Squib is just a mere observer, and a mirror of what is occurring at any time. We have no affiliation to any political party or ideology or race or huma-construct religion. This is one of the only video available of Alex Jones on YouTube after the purge',\n",
       " 'Social medium is a relatively new phenomenon that ha taken the global population by surprise and completely enslaved it in one fell swoop. Today, many people cannot be in a room on their own with their own thought for longer than one minute before they have to look at their social medium accounts. Humans are now relative to drone in the hive mind, where they follow engineered thought pattern globally and are affected in concert by event and trend influencers. The goal of social medium is to give people quick fixes, rewards, to enslave them in a box where their every thought is echoed, where their narcissism can truly take effect. By encapsulating human within this simplistic form of communication, the social medium company are able to extract vast amount of information to not only profit from, but to analyse human behaviour in multiple conditions. Social medium ha engineered a system where complex human behaviour is whittled to nothing more than a few words. This is the crux of the programming of human to completely disable their true ability and dumb them down to mere childish animal behaviour. The incessant chatter of social medium also overtakes the human thought process, and people are now not able to think for themselves without going to social media. Their rational thought process have been dimmed, or completely erased. There is little or no benefit to this, especially for child a they cannot progress a adult human beings, and for adult who use social media, they are reverting to childhood, with petty reward system and the innate inability to form real social relationship face to face. Social medium wa designed to entrap, to subvert humans, and to damage society a a whole, and it is working very well. Selfies Amongst the megalomaniacs, narcissists, sociopaths, and the schizoid that now populate the world of social media, there is a terrible price being paid on humanity, a these people have been permanently altered, their brain now do not function without social media, they are now le tolerant, they are effective psychotic who delete human in their social network with a blink of an eye, or a mouse click. What these social network are engineering is a population of cold hearted killers, because if they can simply delete someone from their social network, what will stop them deleting people in real life? Nothing will stop them, a their mind have been trained and engineered to do so. Thus social medium is creating a mass engineered swathe of nihilistic human with no conscience or ability to empathise in a human manner. There is no given solution to the horror of social media, a prison of the mind where free thought is punished, and anyone who dissent from the indoctrinated hive mind is immediately set upon by mob of social medium thug intent on hurt. We are now seeing this today, where the introduction of term like ‘fake news’, and ‘hate speech’ are used a an Orwellian tool to subvert any form of free speech. All it take is a group of internet thug to report your account and your finished, there are no question asked, and the mob is always right in the eye of the algorithm. If you have children, keep them away from social media. Let them grow a human being who can think rationally, logically and without the need for constant rewards. We must teach child logical thought process and educate them in classical method of thought, yet keep a modern slant on education in a scientific way, a well a culturally with high art. Anyone who us social medium today ha been sadly infected to a point where it will be very hard to ever regain their rational selves, and soul back again. Such is the malaise that whole generations, and swathe of human have now been lost. To destroy these people is now only too easy, all it would take is a switch off, and they would suddenly realise how lost they are. Switching everything off would culminate in a mass population psychotic event. Those who are awake will understand, however those who are hypnotised by social medium are a lost cause, and should be deemed a completely useless human beings.',\n",

       " 'T he foreign exchange market is appealing for many reasons: not only doe it offer a seemingly endless variety of pairs, it also provides the chance to trade based on dynamic, fast-moving news from the world of politics, economics and more. With major currency from time zone around the world available to be traded, the forex market is open for business pretty much all the time during the week – which make it particularly appealing for those who are on flexible schedules. But it doe come with it complications. There are some big technical complexity to get your head around before you can successfully trade the forex markets, and it’s also unpredictable. Here, then, are some way to prepare yourself to enter the market and then get cracking with your first forex trade. What is foreign exchange? Before you even begin to look for a broker, it’s important to spend a much time a you need working out what the forex market is all about. There are many reason why foreign currency are bought and sold, and the main one with which most people are familiar is the exchange of currency for tourist or business travel purpose when heading to a foreign country. But there are other possible reasons. Forex trader buy up currency for speculative reason – which mean they aim to sell it on at a higher price than the one they bought it for, thus making a profit. Others buy foreign currency to “hedge”, or to have an asset which protects them in case the market move in a direction which harm their existing interests. Understanding the fundamental Forex trading instrument differ in appearance and structure from most other offer on the investment market, which mean that those who diversify their trading portfolio from stock and share or similar instrument often find forex a difficult beast at first. Currencies are, for example, always traded in pairs: if you want to trade the US dollar, say, you’ll have to speculate on it rise relative to another currency. Currencies are represented in three-letter codes, such a USD for the dollar, GBP for the British pound, and so on. The two currency in question are separated by a slash, and the first currency in the pair is the one you’re hoping will rise. So, if you want to speculate that the US dollar will go up in value compared to the Japanese yen, for example, you’d need to invest in the USD/JPY pair. There’s much more to forex trading than that, though, and this explanation can only scratch the surface of the foreign exchange market. There are plenty of book and online resource which offer advice on Forex trading for Beginners, and reading these will give you a comprehensive understanding of how this complicated yet often lucrative market work and what it mean for a trader. Find a calendar International economic calendar are absolutely essential tool which should be in the arsenal of every forex trader – perhaps more so than any other financial trading instrument. They come full of important information which trader will need to execute order in an informed manner, so they’re vital. When a country’s central bank update it monetary policy for example, the forex market can shift in minute – and you need to ensure that you’re aware of when these development are happening so that you can price the potential change into your trading decision. Luckily, the calendar are relatively easy to find online – and they’re usually free. Choosing an instrument type In the modern trading world, it’s increasingly common for trader to choose contract for difference – or CFDs – when trading foreign exchange. These instrument are derived from the underlying market, which mean the trader doesn’t actually own the currency. However, they benefit – and lose out – from the same market fluctuation a the “real” currency, and they can usually also access the market much faster a CFD broker are speedy and online-oriented. Forex CFDs can also offer higher profit (and losses) for lower initial deposit a they’re traded on margin – which essentially mean the trader is borrowing the remainder of the required deposit from the broker whenever they open a position. Some trader (or client of traders) prefer to purchase the actual currency itself, and this may be more appropriate if margin trading is not required. Working a a forex trader can be a tough gig, especially once the unpredictability and the complex fundamental principle are taken into account. And with other challenge like integration of accurate economic information into calendar to think about, forex trading can quickly become a hard job. That’s why information calendars, effective instrument type decision and more should all be taken seriously. That way, the chance of your trading career getting off to the most successful and profitable start will be a high a possible.',\n",

Forget about German holidaymaker placing their towel on sun bed at 3am to get the best spot for the next day, a new trend is even more extreme. “These sunseekers storm the beach and get the sun bed before anyone can even bat an eyelid. It’s like the storming of Normandy beach, except in Spain,” one angry tourist said who had to sit on a rock after the prime beach area were taken. The alarming trend is now a frequent occurrence across the whole of Spain’s coast.

In a matter of seconds, my towel had been kicked away and 67 people were sitting in my spot.” These sudden landing by sunseekers is actually great news for Spain, and should be encouraged to the full.

It’s a beautiful sight to see people who are dedicated to the beach life taking so much care and attention to their summer holidays.

       " 'In the word of a great rock band, Kiss, who were mainly Jewish, ‘Everybody’s gotta reason to live’, something, maybe Jeremy Corbyn doe not believe to be true. The right to life, to self determination, is a hard fought right, and certainly the state of Israel ha fought tooth and nail to survive for so long. History is about conquest, and the Jewish state ha a much right to exist a any other state in the world. With regard to anyone criticising Israel a being deemed a anti-semitic, this is another hard paradoxical line in the sand that Jeremy Corbyn ha brought to the fore. In rational discussion, it may be okay to criticise a state’s specific actions, however one should not criticise the state’s reason to exist. All Jewish people have a right to exist a much a any other, and this is the crux of the problem for Corbyn, because he is siding with the like of Hamas, who do not believe that Israel ha a right to exist and all Jews should just keel over and die. That stance, is anti-semitic and Corbyn know it full well. No one should ever forget the holocaust and all the other atrocity meted out on Jews throughout history, and for this, it is their right to fight anti-semitism at every turn. Today, atrocity are committed by all global factions, and indeed Israel ha come down hard on those who sought to attack their state, and in desperation, the Palestinians have committed many atrocity fighting those who they blame for their misfortune. One must again look at history, invention, ingenuity, technique always win through, and the Jews have always been at the forefront of all of these points. The Palestinians never broke through, they never innovated, they never chose the path of ingenuity or technical excellence. Jeremy Corbyn, is now walking a very dangerous tightrope from which he ha possibly tainted the whole Labour party for many year to come. Alienating a very important population strand in Britain and indeed the world, it is only a matter of time before something give and he loses his grip on the party completely.

       " 'The shameful British have forgotten how to rule themselves, they have been slave for so long to Brussels. Theresa May, the current PM, is an insipid scrawny grey pustule who could not make a deal with a paper bag let alone a coterie of unelected official from the EU. Watching the inspiring speech by Trump on Thursday regarding the reintroduction of manufacturing of steel back into the USA wa a momentous moment for many worker who have been bypassed by the like of Obama who favoured communist China over American workers. Trump, much to the chagrin of the American socialist is actually making a difference to many peoples’ lives. Trump’s earlier meeting with Juncker sealed further trade concession from the EU, in just a few hour of talks. Something the timid, listless British cannot do a they cower in the corner scared to even utter a word to their EU masters. Britain indeed is a country enslaved for so long it ha a case of Stockholm Syndrome. If the British had an ounce of the ball that Trump ha we would have been out of the EU prison a long time ago, instead Britain kowtow to every Brussels demand and is left in a shameful imbroglio, a the like of Michel Barnier tighten their octopus grip over the imprisoned country. Britain, infected by the treachery of Remoaners, people who actively seek to do harm to the country by sabotaging every attempt to leave the EU protectionist racket, and it totalitarian Sovietized ideology are a testament that there are many Marxists within the British Isles. One day hopefully they will be rooted out and made to pay for their crimes. Can’t we hire Trump for at least one hour to go at it at the EU? He would no doubt stride into the meeting, slap something on the table, then say take it or leave it. The EU would capitulate or be thrown into total disarray. This is how Trump would negotiate with the EU, who are using Britain’s cowardice and negativity to great effect. Apart from a few Brexiteers in parliament, no one ha any ball anymore. Even the grandchild of Churchill, the bloated cochon Soames ha been paid off by the EU and would sell off Britain at the drop of a hat. How ironic that Soames is now a Haw Haw. Winston Churchill most certainly did not give him any ball down the line, a he waddle around the Commons floor like a fat cheap whore on the take. That spinning sound you hear when Soames speaks is the sound of his grandfather in his grave. Winston Churchill’s vision of the EU wa one led by Britain and France, and not Germany, and this is the crux of the matter. Whilst Britain wa a member of the EU it had no say, and no power. If no one step up soon to delete Theresa May, and her Remoaners, all will be lost.

Much of the loss for these FANG stock will be the precursor for more fall a time go by, because investor have been hit hard with the fall. No one with a brain or a wallet want to touch these stocks, simply because of the climate we are in now. On the bright side, at least Zuckerberg burned a new U.S record. The one day drop of Facebook wa the highest stock market single day loss in known American history. Socialists are meant to be inclusive This climate is an Orwellian deluge of mass censorship, mass deletions, and un-inclusivity. What the socialist who run these tech medium company do not realise is that they are censoring the spice that made their boring format exciting. Anyone with an education and logical thought process can see if a post is rather iffy or outrageous, but they watch the video for entertainment purposes. There is no need to censor something purely because it doe not conform to socialist political ideals. There ha been mass censorship of all conservative view on these platforms, there ha also been shadow-banning, and mass deletion of account that did not conform to the communistic view of the controller in charge. What we have now is a completely one-sided platform on place like YouTube and Facebook, where anything with an alternative view is labelled a ‘hate speech’ then removed. Orwellian Thoughtcrime Defining ‘hate speech’ is a difficult proposal, but much can be plonked into it allocation folder. Much like George Orwell’s 1984, we are seeing anything that doe not hold the American democratic socialist party’s line of thought a ‘hate speech’. By removing the essence of discussion, of opposing views, you see a decline in conversation, a fall in debate, and thus these platform are now merely propaganda machine for the American socialist to feed off each other a everyone else is excluded from the debate. To question something is now deemed a ‘hate crime’ because the questioning go against the narrative or socialist conditioning that is constantly put out by the tech company and the socialist controlled media. Censorship kill discussion, censorship kill art, and censorship kill the fundamental reason why the internet, world wide web wa created. Berners-Lee surely would agree? Censoring formerly protected genre Google ha even severely censored the Daily Squib, which is an essentially satirical parody news format, and in history satire/parody ha only been heavily censored by totalitarian communist and fascist regimes. We can therefore surmise, that this time we are living in is one of a totalitarian regime, where even the supposedly protected genre of satire is attacked. Our YouTube channel which we stopped using, wa shadow-banned year ago. There is no point in posting a video on the channel because it will not get any view anymore. We tested this by uploading one of our video onto a new created account with a different name and it immediately received ten of thousand of views. The original video in our official account got 120 view over five years. This is the level of censorship we are dealing with, where creativity, innovation and alternative view are crushed to leave a bland landscape of ‘yes men’, a hive like culture where everyone say the same thing and think in the same way. Humanity never progressed much when everyone said the same thing, and everyone agreed. Fuck that! What these tech company are essentially doing is aligning themselves with communist China and it censorship technique. Facebook is itching to get into the Chinese market, therefore they are aligning themselves with the same communist ideal a the Chinese. One can only hope that the censor bring these FANG stocks, and the rest of the fucking NASDAQ down by another 40-60%.

French Masculine and Feminine Every French noun is either masculine or feminine, and this affect how the noun is treated. One more or le ha to memorise the gender of each noun, although you can often tell whether a word is masculine or feminine by looking at it ending. Masculine noun often have the ending: aire. In French the pronoun (Le, La, Les) will depend on the gender of the noun in question. All the noun are masculine or feminine. For masculine noun “The” is Le, whilst for feminine noun “The” is La. If the noun is plural then “The” becomes Les. For example : The pig = Le cochon The whore = La putain The dog = Les chiens French Language Gender Dispute The French gender issue arose when one activist took a semester of linguistics and wa shocked how the French language only catered for masculine and feminine nouns. Donny Fargotte, 23, a student activist wa outraged by the exclusion of transexual noun and verb in the French language and it exclusivity to masculine and feminine. “This is gender fascism. We detest masculine, the word masculine itself is an attack on every gender status and should be outlawed, but to have a language that only ha masculine and feminine description of noun is disgusting. I stood up in my class and shouted. I cried and cried for three day at this outrageous exclusion of all other genders. This is why we have a big problem. We are going to petition the French government to change their language.” Some of the suggestion proposed by the activist is to change (Le, La, Les) to (Ze, Zee, Zees) and that all reference to masculine and feminine grammar be erased completely. On Tuesday, a Boycott French day will be held at the campus, and next week, a visiting professor from a French university will probably be met with riots.',\n",

Most certainly, the event will be an economic eviscerating maelstrom that will lead into anarchic catastrophe with gang roaming, mass looting, and cataclysmic death to many who are unprepared. You see, the wealthy, the elite, are prepared, they have already secured plot of land with shelters, some underground, some in very secluded spots, but these wealthy elite still have one problem, how to keep their security and manual worker loyal to them when the event happens. It will be all too easy for the security detail to band together and take over the wealthy in their luxurious bunkers. What do you do when paper money is worthless, and your security men surround you with the gun you gave them? How doe one keep the loyalty of the servant during a cataclysmic event wiping out all of society economically? There are certainly no easy solution to such a debacle, but the only real solution is for these billionaire who have never done anything with their hands, or had a manual job, to actually hold a gun themselves. Many will not be able to and will perish. The first thing that happens in a major economic disaster is that all the rich in every neighbourhood are quickly dispatched and their homes/businesses looted. The swarmiing poor are vast in numbers, and when there is no police to protect the wealthy, the rich are the first to go. When that source is depleted, the people turn on themselves. Of course there are alternatives, but the technology for robot and automated guard controlled by sophisticated AI is still in it infancy. It will take another thirty to forty year to replicate human in their entirety, but even then there will be major flaws. The time line for such an event nears every day, simply because the populace are getting more and more uncontrollable every day. The economic system built on debt, is not built on a firm foundation, and sooner or later it will give away. The Illusion will be lost overnight, the illusion of democracy, the illusion of economic prosperity, and furthermore, the interlinked global economy will crumble in one fell swoop, purely because there are little or no way to quarantine contagion. Already, there are brief murmur of such an event occurring, and you will know when it happens because you will not see any police in the street any more, no medics, no social services, and there will be no way of getting your money out of the banks. All mobile phone will cease working in an instant, a well a electricity grids, and water processing centres. In effect, there will be silence. This silence will be the starting bell for carnage, anarchy and total chaos to reign over the crumbling old system, which will be cleansed over many year of nihilistic purges. Even though this warning wa written in full sight, many will not heed it, and they will carry on with their meaningless life a slave to their mortgage and tax slave jobs. What do people do when there is no more food in the shops, when paper money is useless, and there is no authority? The answer is they do anything to survive. Anything.',\n",

Officers think several Russians were involved in the attempted murder of the former double agent and daughter Yulia in Salisbury and are looking for more than one suspect. A source with knowledge of the investigation said: “The team of Russians have been identified and we have released their name after we found out who they were. We urge the public to be very cautious if they meet one of these men, do not accept any drink from them or perfume bottles.” The suspect have been named a Vlad Putinski, Valdimir Putana, Vladimirski Putinov, Vladimirov Putinoff, and finally Vladi Puttitov. These men were last seen walking down Salisbury High Street, close to where the poisoning from nerve agent Novichok wa discovered. Do not approach these Russians if you come into contact with them, either run in the other direction or call the police immediately. They are very dangerous and have copious amount of Novichok on their person at all times.',\n",

The Russians have key Kompromat documentation and photographic, video evidence about Trump’s past visit to Russia and what he got up to. Allegedly, the Russians have extensive footage of Trump’s visit in 2013 with numerous prostitute urinating on a hotel bed where Obama once slept, then indulging in ‘golden showers’. Igor Federov, an observer revealed the in and out of the situation. “One can see the fear in Trump’s eye a he cowers before his master. All it would take is one wave of the hand, and Trump would not only be completely disgraced, but he would no doubt be impeached and thrown to the dogs. Trump agreed to every word that Putin said denying all knowledge of U.S. electoral tampering, and in the light of the recent Novichok poisoning in the UK, he did not even mention that either. This is a classic case of Kompromat.” One Associated Press reporter, Jonathan Lemire, seeing how the president sheepishly cowered in Putin’s presence, even dared to ask Putin whether the Russians had any compromising material on Trump. Putin of course masterly denied the fact, although Trump practically sank into the podium.

       " 'Britain ha been at war for some time. We are now in a Brexit war, where Britain will either sink or swim. This war is both internal and external. The concept of leaving the EU completely i.e. Brexit, is actually a very simple notion that ha been muddied by Remoaners in Parliament, and the EU, who have sought to stifle every part of the process of Brexit. What Brexit initially means, and what the people voted for on June 23, 2016, is for Britain to leave the EU single market, to leave EU law and law courts, and to leave the EU Customs Union. This can all be achieved by applying WTO rule to trade and completely cutting tie with the EU court and laws. In effect, on Brexit, no EU law would be valid in a UK court. The myriad of EU law that have already been incorporated into the UK would have to all eventually be looked at and amended, but this is not a matter of grave urgency a other part of Brexit will be. Regarding the EU red herring of the Irish border, this is inconsequential. It is a matter for the EU what they do with their EU customs. It ha nothing to do with Britain at all, and the UK should simply leave the EU to ponder on it. Imports and export to the EU and world will also continue under WTO rules, and the regulatory minefield that the EU creates for everything is their problem. Many product do not actually need tariffs, so it is a question of dealing with those that do. The UK just ha to acknowledge that the EU ha tonne of regulation for everything, and that is that. Let the EU over regulate and indulge in useless bureaucracy and inhibitive protectionism, where the UK will not stifle business any more. Passporting right for City worker is also another contentious issue. This can be solved very easily by ignoring the whole issue. Most UK firm do not actually need passporting rights. London will always be the centre of the financial world simply because of it location, and it time zone. Trade deal and immigration are of course a foremost subject to include. All it would take is a team of dedicated people six month to establish new trade deals, and to take back complete control of Britain’s border by implementing a funnelling system with regard to EU migration unless applicant have high paying job and mean to support themselves. There would naturally have to be new migration policy written to accommodate the new rules. America and Australia are begging the UK for new trade deals, a well a the lucrative South East Asian markets. Migration is good for the UK, and the economy, however we must implement a more controlled approach a opposed to unfettered. As for the million of EU migrant who have come to Britain and are utilising our benefit system, and are not employed or employable. They will be given a cut off period of three month to find a job or be sent back to the EU. There have also been many instance of Third World citizen buying EU citizenship from Malta. These people will all be removed forthwith and sent back to their respective countries. The UK ha also been blighted by thousand of EU criminals, who when caught and imprisoned are a large taxpayer burden. Because of EU courts, these criminal were not able to be sent back to the EU. After Brexit, all EU criminal within Britain’s prison system will be returned to the EU immediately. British citizen living in the EU will have their future on the line because the EU is a vindictive nasty player and will not afford them any clemency. They therefore have two choices, stay in their respective EU territory and apply for citizenship, or come back to the UK. It would also serve Britain to increase the number of migration centre for the number of people who will be processed and sent back will be many. As for the CAP, tied in with Brussels, this would all be scrapped immediately. Farming subsidy will revert to the UK government. All inhibitive EU regulation would be scrapped immediately. All fishing right within British sea channel would be for use only by British fishermen. This would be enforced by the Royal Navy who would get extra funding and ship to patrol the fishing areas. Any illegal fisherman from the Continent would be first warned, and if they refuse, they would be arrested. All payment to Brussels will cease immediately. Britain should also not have to pay a ransom amount of £45 billion stipulated by the EU, and will refuse all payments. The EU may pursue this in their court but this would take many years, and Britain should carry on refusing payment indefinitely. The UK government could reciprocate on any EU punishment doled out in vindictive anger by enticing worldwide corporate business to the UK shore with lower taxation rates, and other incentives, effectively undercutting the EU. This would make the UK into a magnet for corporation and increase business activity and entrepreneurship tenfold making the UK into a global hub of International business. As for Remoaners; who have sided with the enemy, have taken illicit payment from the EU, have constantly talked Britain down and betrayed it people, they should be tried in the courts. There is no doubt that many Remoaners in parliament are receiving large sum of money from the enemy, including the meddler George Soros, the Open Society financier, to thwart Britain’s run for Brexit freedom and International trading success. From this point we must take a military stance to proceeding a there will be many loose end that need to be tied. The process of Brexit, if looked upon in a military fashion is very simple, and it should be treated clinically a if we are in a time of war. This war, will take a lot of patience, dedication and sheer will to win, but it is winnable, Brexit can be achieved very easily be simply removing the factor that step in it way. Once a problem factor is identified, it must be targeted, then removed, so we can move on. Brexit can be achieved quickly and effectively, but there will have to be ruthless decision made with clinical precision and technique.',\n",

Kommandant Selmayr, whose grandfather wa lieutenant-colonel Josef Selmayr, a convicted war criminal – later pardoned – who served in the Balkans fighting for Hitler in WW2, ha no love for the English. “Every time the Kommandant hears the name of an English person, or England, his face go sour, I once saw him spit into his wastepaper bin when someone mentioned ‘Windsor Castle’. The Kommandant is very particular about the EU ruining Britain, he always say that even though Germany lost the war in 1945, we won in the end with the EU. He is of course correct 100%, because it is now the UK that take order from the EU, and who rule the EU? Yes, you guessed it — Germany!” Kommandant Selmayr wa recently promoted to his post by Jean Claude Juncker, whose father wa a prominent Nazi fighting on the Russian front in WW2 a well. Juncker’s father-in-law, Louis Mathias Frising — dad to Juncker’s wife of 35 year Christiane — wa a teacher in Ettelbruck, Luxembourg, when the Germans invaded in 1940. Frising volunteered to be a Nazi propaganda chief while banning spoken French in favour of German. He wa also responsible for enforcing a law which stripped Jews of their right and profession — the first stage of the Holocaust. “So, a you can see you Englischer swine, the hierarchy of the EU is currently run by people who have a Nazi lineage.

We must also not forget the many who fought alongside the RAF, especially in World War II, the USAAF/USAF who bolstered the RAF from 1942 onwards in winning the war against Germany with many daring raid into enemy territory. The RAF during the Battle of Britain saved these shore from the Luftwaffe, with ultimate bravery and skill. RAF Bravery Pilots like Flight Lieutenant James Nicolson who wa on patrol near Southampton on 16 August 1940, when his Hawker Hurricane wa fired on by a German fighter aircraft. Making the ‘loudest noise [he] had ever heard’, four cannon shell thudded into his cockpit, damaging his machine, setting his petrol tank alight and wounding him in the eye, leg and heel. Surrounded by flame and with blood pouring down him from his injuries, Nicolson prepared to bail out. But just a he did so, he spotted a Messerschmitt Bf 110 ahead. Despite being in severe pain, he put down his parachute and reached instead for his gun controls. He poured fire into the German aircraft, keeping up his assault even a it tried to turn and twist away from him. As he attacked, Nicolson noticed that the intense heat of the cockpit wa burning his flesh. Only then did he abandon his Hurricane. After giving the Messerschmitt one last burst, he struggled free of his blazing cockpit and tumbled out into the sky. Nicolson deployed his parachute and, a he fell, he took stock of his extensive injuries, noticing that he could see the bone of his left hand showing through the knuckles. He managed to land in a field and wa rushed to hospital, where his life hung in the balance. After several weeks, he had recovered enough to make it out of danger, but the burn he had received took much longer to heal. Nicolson wa awarded the Victoria Cross, which he received from King George VI at Buckingham Palace in November 1940. More Stories of RAF bravery here. USAAF After America joined the war in 1941, it wa not until 1942 when the USAAF landed in Britain.

His itinerary involves him travelling straight to Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire, where Theresa May is supposed to host Mr Trump and his wife Melania for a black-tie dinner with 100 guest and ministers. The question is, after the Chequers fiasco, where Theresa May revealed her Brexit In Name Only plan, will the president want to meet Theresa May? The US Ambassador Woody Johnson, ha already voiced his opinion on Theresa May’s BRINO plan, and ha questioned whether any future bilateral US trade deal would be possible after the complete Chequers capitulation to the EU by May and her Remainer Cabinet. Donald Trump, who is conducting a trade war with the EU, will not be happy by Theresa May’s complete betrayal of 17.4 million voter who voted for a Brexit on June 23, 2016. “My guess is, Mr. Trump will attend the dinner, however, he will not be able to look in the quisling Theresa May’s eyes, out of shame for her, and how she betrayed her own country just to stay in office. He will speak a few word to her, but nothing important, and ignore the witch for the rest of the evening and the next day,” a senior Trump aide revealed. President Donald Trump will visit on the Friday, a defence installation where he will try to bolster NATO further by trying to persuade May to increase UK military spending, which will most probably be like trying to get blood out of a stone. Theresa May is not interested in Britain’s defence a she is Remainer and belief Britain should erradicate it armed force so that the EU can save it during a time of war. Under her insipid reign, the armed force have seen their military budget cut to a pittance, rendering it a useless fighting force if there ever were a conflict. On the same day, after the military discussion, Trump will be ferried off to Chequers, a scene of a grave crime against Britain. There, Theresa May will hope to discus trade deal with the president, but it is not certain he will want to discus them with May. Then after a non-working-lunch, it’s off to meet the Queen at Windsor Castle where Trump will amuse her Majesty with some of his American charm. The Donald, will then hang out in his golf course in Scotland until he leaf on Sunday back to the US. Luckily for the president, he will go nowhere near Central London where a crowd of socialist and communist are planning a rally replete with a London Mayor approved blow-up doll of Trump fashioned a a big baby. The London Mayor, Sadiq Khan, instead of fighting rampant knife crime and murder in the Capital, is instead putting all of his effort into not only denigrating his own office with puerile anti-Trump show but putting a big stain on the whole of the UK by agreeing to this pathetic socialist protest against a very important ally, and saviour of Britain in two World Wars.',\n",

Our Sub Sub Editor wa so furious and disgusted that he threw his Commodore 64 out of the window then ran into the photocopy closet to masturbate furiously to sate his nerves. Another writer wa last seen walking down the High Street wearing nothing but a policeman’s hat. We are drinking in the pub and this article wa written on a piece of napkin then transported to an internet cafe where it wa posted on the site.

       " 'And the curtain fall with an almighty flop. With the sour news that a Soft Brexit wa agreed by Brexiteers in Theresa May’s Cabinet, one can only think that this is a sad day for Britain. We liked Boris, but not any more, and a for the others like Gove, well, there is nothing left to say, apart from what a bunch of losers. The Theresa May proposal will tie the UK to the EU law and regulation indefinitely. Businesses and agriculture will continue to be bogged down by EU red tape and regulation costing business and the Treasury billion every year. It is safe to also change the moniker for former Brexiteers in the Cabinet to Cowardeers, or just plain old Cowards would do the job. We have thus witnessed the end of the Conservative party a we knew it, many will cheer, and many will be relieved at their demise, but it will leave a gap in the political sphere, especially regarding Brexit. This is why it is time Nigel Farage come back to either reignite UKIP or start an altogether different eurosceptic Brexit party. By bringing in a third party, the death of the Conservative party would be accelerated. Maybe a fitting punishment, vote Corbyn at the next election. Now is the time to completely abandon the Conservatives, simply because the party are no longer what they say they are. If you have ever voted for the Conservatives in the past, never do it again. This is a sad day for democracy in Britain.The Tories are a national disgrace, laced with traitor and yellow coward not fit for purpose. And for this BRINO worse off position than before with no say, the UK will shuffle off £40 Billion to the EU?',\n",
       " 'By ignoring over 17.8 million voters, the Tories could be out of power for over thirty year and deemed unelectable if the real Brexit is not adhered to, say a panel of political expert at the Institute of Electoral Behaviour and Political Science. Constitutional National Crisis “It is a certainty that if the mandated EU Referendum vote for Brexit Britain taking back control of it borders, law and trade, a wa voted for on June 23, 2016, is not delivered, then there will be a voter backlash against the Conservative government. Essentially, the people who voted for a Brexit will vote against the Conservatives, and remove the Tories condemning them to a long hiatus in the wilderness. We estimate the strength of feeling in this matter to result in a twenty to thirty year exile,” Dr. Philip Arthur, revealed. There is certainly a threat of a vast voter backlash if there are serious capitulation to Brussels, and this would not fare well with the Conservatives for a long time. “We have studied the data, and analysed the behavioural habit of voter concluding these result of a voter backlash. However, we have also concluded that not only could there be a backlash at the polls, but the resultant discontent could spread to mass civil disobedience and rioting for a period of thirty to forty years. This is not an exaggeration but a valid assessment of voter fury and public anguish over being betrayed and democracy circumnavigated for EU totalitarian rule.”',\n",
       " 'Theresa May campaigned strongly for Remain during the EU Referendum - photo - Twitter Okay, let u supply some simple logic that most people will understand. Remoaners/Remainers do not want a Brexit. They do not want to leave the European Union. Makes no sense So, here’s the clincher. If these people, these Remoaners are against Brexit at all costs, why is the PM Theresa May, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, over half the Cabinet in charge of Brexit? Who thought up this piece of illogical nonsense? It ha to be said that behind the scene must reside a chief Remoaner who is directing this farcical tragedy, and they are responsible for putting these Remoaners into the pot to stir thing up. There is no logic in letting a Remoaner fifty foot within a Brexit negotiation. That’s like asking your enemy’s collaborator to come and discus an important war strategy meeting against your enemy. It is therefore a valid supposition that the reason for instating Remoaners into the high position dealing with Brexit, is to completely thwart the process, and at the moment, it seems to be working very well. If there wa to have been a real Brexit, Remoaners would have been kept well away, because they are actively working against Britain’s interests, and seek to destroy any thought of a proper Brexit a voted by 17.8 million voter on June 23, 2016 during the EU Referendum. Solution: Unless there is an immediate removal of Remoaners from the Brexit proceeding and governmental control, then there will not be a Brexit, but Brexit can be achieved if these Remoaners are removed. That is the only way a real Brexit can occur. The likelihood of this happening at the moment are however very slim, simply because the Brexiteers we have in the mix do not seem to want to make any sort of move to oust the quislings. Until they remove the Remoaners, there will be big problem resulting in a ‘Brexit In Name Only’ (BRINO) or in other word a ‘Soft Brexit’, where the UK is still controlled by the EU.',\n",

The city lie only 9 mile away from Stonehenge, the prehistoric stone circle on the grassland of Salisbury Plain. You won’t be able to move away after your visit and will stay in that spot for a very long, long time. We have compiled a list of five wondrous landmark to visit on your trip to Salisbury. NoviChok Forest – If you love acre and acre of tree then you will not love this place. Most of the tree within the forest are now dead or diseased from some type of mysterious chemical compound. There are still a few tree standing so when you bring your picnic gear be prepared for involuntary nervous twitch just before succumbing to complete paralysis and entering into a coma. ChokNovi Cathedral – This magnificent 13th Century cathedral also hold the Magna Carta, which ha now been re-written in Russian. Sit on a pue, and listen to the Bishop bash away some inane outdated mythical nonsense whilst you are paralysed in your seat, unable to even move your fucking eyes. When it is time to pray, simply slump forward in a coma. Not unlike any other church experience we hear you say, however this one is vastly different, you rarely wake up…ever again. The NoviFish ChokShop – Situated on the High Street down a dark alley, to get there you must step over many comatose bodies. These poor soul tried to get to the fish shop for a bit of cod and chips, but sadly never made it. You probably won’t either a you feel your muscle seize up after a few steps. Putin’s Laughing Pub – For a real taste of Salisbury, this pub is full of Russians, most certainly FSB agent who spend their day laughing at the British secret service for such a poor job catching them. Curiously enough, it is the safest place now in Salisbury a there is no nerve agent present. Why would the Russians want to infect themselves? No non-Russians or dog allowed at any time. NoviPizza Chok Restaurant – What better place to put your foot up and relax after a hard day’s sightseeing than this excellent pizzeria. The only problem is, before your dish is served up, your throat will suddenly feel tight a the paralysis set in and you will spend the rest of the evening staring at your food, frothing and dribbling from the mouth whilst smelling the delicious aroma, but without the ability to eat it.

The astounding England v Colombia game last night at the Spartak stadium in Moscow wa a tour de force of football and had spectator practically on their knee with excitement and anguish. End to end, with England leading by one goal, the Colombians pulled an equaliser out of a magician’s hat in the last minute of the game via numero 13, defender, Yerry Mina. Extra time to score that elusive goal, wa elusive and we were onto penalties. This is the clincher, England are notorious at being shit at taking penalties, but this time around they bit the bullet and knuckled down with an excellent ‘thwack!’ from Eric Dier finalising the tally, thus consigning the Colombian team to another lonely and apprehensive journey home back to South America. Hopefully, Mateus Uribe and Carlos Bacca, who both missed their penalty shots, will be left in peace, and not gunned down just because some Cartagena cartel bos lost a bet. Returning to Colombia after leaving the World Cup, first thing to do is order in a posse of bodyguard until all the hysteria ha calmed down a bit.',\n",

Remoaners do not have backbone a standard. However, in the interest of the nation’s standing, we are prepared to deliver one to be installed into any MP who is willing and capable of accommodating such a thing a a fucking backbone,” one of the controller of the Backbone Section located deep in Whitehall revealed. Spineless coward If requested, the backbone would be delivered to a special room in the House of Commons where it would be implanted into the person, and then they would deliver a proper Brexit a mandated by the people on June 23, 2016. “A lot of these fellow don’t have backbones. They are yellow jelly bellied cowards, so it is not certain how we would implement the project,” another controller revealed. Certainly, there are many contender amongst the Brexiteer team, however one of them ha to really step up to receive the backbone, and even then thing could backfire. “Well it’s not just a backbone that will be required. We’ll also need a pair of big swinging bollocks. Without that combination then the backbone will not have full effect.

       " '“If you smoke enough of this shit, you definitely will think you are Jesus the Son of God and can perform miracles,” one Bible scholar commented after toking on a large joint. According to a team of Bible scholar from Colorado University, marijuana and cannabis oil were common place during the era of Jesus in Judea, and much of the population were whacked out on the stuff. “Like say I smoked three joint off the cuff, then rubbed cannabis oil all over my body and I wa on a mountain. It is highly likely I would see a burning bush and hear it talking to me. I mean this shit is so strong you hallucinate with it. If you have schizoid tendencies, you might even hear the voice of God telling you you have to sacrifice your own son to prove your unquestionable allegiance to the God. For fuck’s sake man, if someone did this shit today they would put them away permanently in an asylum…but because in the day of little or no science and goat herders, they put it in a book and called it the word of God.” Cannabliss Although the Christian Bible wa written by unknown author 400 year after the supposed event took place, it ha been posited that many of the writer were on drug too. “From the rhetoric of the Bible which wa written during the fall of the Roman Empire and it transition to Christianity, many of the mystic that wrote the story were on cannabis. It wa a staple drug for many writer because it wa good for the imagination. Writing while whacked out on ganja open up avenue never before seen, so these people were going on about fable and mystery of the era and expanding on them. There are no record of Jesus ever existing, even though the Romans were meticulous record keeper for taxation purposes. One must understand that Jesus is an amalgamation of many deity from the region, and at the time of the fall of the Roman Empire, they really needed something to supersede the authority of the emperors.” It wa not only cannabis that many mystic took at the time, but psychotropic hallucinogenic substance derived from certain cacti, and plants. Harmal, Peganum harmala, wa used all across the Middle East, not only a a mystical tool for hallucination but a a remedy for many ailments. Most world religion are derived from altered state of consciousness, and the root for many religion that still survive today come from early shamanistic practice from early tribe who travelled the plains. These shaman ingested hallucinogenic plant derivative and cannabis a an aid to acquiring an altered state of consciousness. “The process of grinding wild mushrooms, ingesting them then having an out of body hallucinogenic experience is a old a man itself. This dissociative state wa seen a finding God. Basically, by taking mind altering drugs, man began to formulate their own religion from not only their surroundings but from their belief system and expand upon these to create elaborate story and religions. If you take enough drugs, you will see heaven, you will see hell and you will hear the word of God. Drugs are the channel to another state of awareness, and some say another dimension.”',\n",
       " 'When Remainer PM Theresa May say something, it generally mean nothing, or it is doublespeak to enable further delaying tactic so that the outcome of said word is a muddled dish of confusion. Speaking to one group of people on one side, Theresa May say what they want to hear, then when speaking to the opposite side she will tell them exactly what they want to hear. The result is that nothing happens and the so-called event is delayed until it is too late, and the status quo can remain without any opposition. “I seek to confuse the Brexiteers, appease the Remoaners, and sincerely bow down to kiss the boot of the Brussels overlords. I am what would be deemed a a quisling, a sleeping agent within the highest office of government who detests the people, and their nefarious choice to leave the European Union. I say I believe in Brexit but that is not true. “My order are thus to delay any exit from the EU for a long a possible, enabling Remoaners, the EU and the House of Lords to inflict a much pain on Brexit a possible. If I wa a PM who wished for Brexit, this event would have occurred within three month of my instatement a PM, however I have eked proceeding out for over three years, and seek to delay for even more time.” As for the Brexiteers, they are fool for believing any word spoken from the PM, and yet they stand by, afraid to lose their position in government more than their country’s future. This push and pull force, is a staple governmental technique utilised to fool the people, who watch daily a the appeasing headline are released to the mainstream media. “Brexit is happening”, “Only Two Years to Brexit”, “EU Shaking in Their Boots”, “Support May in Her Brexit Victory”. Of course utter tosh and lies, but the people are placated easily, they actually believe the word they read in the papers, and the word that come out of Theresa May’s puppet mouth. The fucking stone cold truth is that there will be NO Brexit. No Brexiteers will stand up to Theresa May’s lie and Nigel Farage will stand by with the lot of them without doing anything. Remember these word clearly — The people’s vote doe not matter. We are not living in a democracy. You have no right a a voter to make a decision on the country’s future.

       " 'The University of Linguistics in Mississippi is calling for the ban of the latin word for white – ‘Album’. The scholar for the university are outraged that the latin word for ‘black’ is banned, but not white. “These amount to double standards. Why ban the Latin word for black, but keep the word for white, it is a form of racism that we should not tolerate? We, today live by the standard and root of Latin, and this should be adhered to within our linguistic and societal discourse,” professor Reginald Dwight, told assembled college member at a recent meeting. Another scholar counteracted the argument by suggesting that the Latin word for black should be un-banned, therefore, the word for white, would be left alone and not banned a well. However, banning the word for the colour white in Latin, Album, could have implication in the music biz. Record executive, Donald D. Negreponte, for Warner Bros. wa adamant that problem could arise. “What we gonna call album then? We been callin’ that shiet album since the beginning of the mufuggin’ recording industry. Niggaz need to all calm da fuck down, an shiet. I axe all y’all foos to stop runnin’ around like headless chickins and can the hysteria about Latin!” The discussion is ongoing, and many, especially in socialist state across America where there is a large African American lobby are not calling for the banning of the Latin word for the colour white, simply because it will mean that it is a important a the Latin word for black, which is banned from everyday usage. “You can’t ban the word white in Latin. Simply because by banning a word, you make it important, and you elevate it to a special status in linguistic usage. We don’t want white to have the same special status a black in America, to use the word to lament over eternally, and to use it a a reason for our victim status. No! Definitely not,” Reverend Kessell Johnsons, said at a recent rally in Chicago.',\n",
       " 'Less than a week after President Trump sought to dispel public outrage by signing an executive order ending the practice of separating child from parent illegally crossing into the U.S., there ha been a second—altogether unexpected backlash—from the kid themselves. Abe Moskowitz, a lawyer for six-year-old Emanuel Honduro Gonzalez, claim that once his client wa reunited with his parent “he went into a full blown panic.” Emanuel wa apparently having the time of his life in the cage. “Kids to befriend, an array of toys, plus state-of-the-art air-conditioning.” Moskowitz went on to point out that Emanuel’s situation certainly beat “trekking across the infernal 140 degree Arizona desert with only cactus needle a sustenance.” Emanuel’s reaction is in no way unique. Indeed, CNN ha reported hundred of case of kid “kicking and screaming” and “throwing toy at I.C.E. members” once confronted with the crushing reality that they would be reunited with their parents. Analysis Psychologist Amanda Beasley, a professor at Yale University, explained it this way. “A child under the guidance of his parent is actually a thousand time more imprisoned than a child in a cage.” Beasley went on to suggest that “real individuation must start early—perhaps even a few week after the child is expelled from the womb.” Social Worker, Zeke Thomas, however, ha a different point of view. “These kid are suffering from a cage-based version of Stockholm syndrome. The allure they have for their cage simply make no rational sense!” Complicating matter further, many parent are reacting in unexpected way to seeing their child again. Gloria Espinoza, a mother from Honduras, started feeling despondent and had to go on Lexapro shortly after being reunited with her three sons. Before she could watch Telemundo for day without interruption, but now she spends all her free time breastfeeding, changing diapers, and, on occasion, narrowly avoiding getting bludgeoned to death by a building block. Lupe Constanza feel similarly despondent and now take a heavy-dose of Ativan since the return of her nine daughter and two son ha brought on a series of uncontrollable panic attacks. “I thought Trump wa like Hitler for keeping u apart,” she said. “But now I think the real crime against humanity is reuniting our family.

       " 'From across the pond, somewhat removed, it is hard to see the American socialist making such a fool of themselves. These are supposedly inclusive people with an ideology of progressive tolerance and yet they are acting like fascists; non inclusive, intolerant, prone to censor, authoritarian, totalitarian and increasingly violent. Hitler himself would be proud of the Democrats because they are exhibiting the exact behaviour of the Nazi party leading up to World War II. Hitler’s National Socialist party wa a form of socialism and left wing, they were intolerant of other views, they censored heavily and shut down any form of free speech. This is the left wing credo now, an intolerant, non inclusive hate mongering mob of thug who cannot discus anything in a civil educated manner. Your own hatred for Trump creates more hatred, because you are stuck in the mindset of anger, you create more anger, and your unwillingness to discus or even acknowledge anything that is not in your worldview creates more discord and alienation. Donald Trump against the backdrop of wailing, whining violent bullying democrat look civilised. Against the baying democrat hound answering the race baiting call for violent action from Maxine Waters, Trump is again, the civilised one. The same go for Peter Fonda, asking for paedophile to rape Trump’s 11-year-old son, Barron. Donald Trump is the civilised one. To see Trump’s administrative staff hounded out of restaurants, confronted outside their homes, is similar in behaviour to the Jews in Nazi Germany being turfed out of shop and other public spaces. There is no positive mature educated behaviour being exhibited by American socialist at the moment, and frankly, you are the bad guys, because you are acting like bad guy act in everything you are doing. If it is violence the American socialist crave, then they would not fare well in a fight, because they don’t own guns, and don’t know how to shoot straight, whereas the conservative do and can. Every day, Trump is increasing in strength, power and stature, whilst the democrat are looking increasingly dilapidated and silly. This applies to the medium companies, the Hollywood celebrities, the pseudo-Marxist fascist university professor indoctrinating their flock, and the bleeding heart socialist thug who have to virtue signal at every point of their miserable insufferable existence. Sometimes it pay to step back and look in to see what reality is really about, and for American socialist who manage to do that, they will not like what they see. For positive change to occur nationally, globally all side must join collectively and inclusively because fighting only creates more fighting. Step back for one second and take a look…',\n",

Speaking from his cage in his Hollywood mansion, Sheen wa eager to reveal the benefit of the new craze amongst celebrities. “I feel like I’m a kid who just walked across the border from Guatemala. It make me proud to be American, because I not only feel at one with the United States, and Obama who started this practice, but I feel like a lost kid. Like I sit in the corner like this, I cry out for my mama and suck my thumb. I even have a blanket, although I burned some hole in this one with cigarette ash. I feel safe here. I don’t wanna get out.” Another celebrity who ha adopted the cage life is Danny Devito, who sits in his cage and even wear a nappy. “I asked Arnie the other day if he wanted to join me in my cage. He said no, because he could not even fit his leg in it. They (Devito’s Mexican servants) cart me around the house in my cage, and they feed me burrito through the little hole. It make me feel good a a liberal champagne socialist to be treated like those kid at the border, like I can atone for my liberal value by sitting in this cage and receiving the same punishment those poor Mexican bastard receive at the border.” There have been accident though, and one celebrity did not fare too well whilst in her cage. Roseanne Barr tried out cage life after being barred from her own show because she uttered a few word on Twitter that were deemed racist. “They (the producer of her show) actually put me in the cage without my consent. Then they started making ‘Ook ook’ noise to show me what it feel like to be on the receiving end of racism. I cried and cried, but they still did not give me my own show back.” As for actor Peter Fonda, his latest hobby is not so much centred around a cage but an echo chamber. It could be described a a left-leaning digital prison where people parrot the same ol’ leftist outrage and it echo from one side to the other for eternity — i.e Twitter.',\n",

Actor Peter Fonda, wa quoted on twitter after seeing the Obama era pictures: “WE SHOULD RIP BARRON TRUMP FROM HIS MOTHER’S ARMS AND PUT HIM IN A CAGE WITH PEDOPHILES AND SEE IF MOTHER WILL WILL STAND UP AGAINST THE GIANT ASSHOLE SHE IS MARRIED TO. 90 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE STREETS ON THE SAME WEEKEND IN THE COUNTRY. FUCK,” What many ‘low information’ champagne socialist do not know is that the policy of putting immigrant child in cage wa instated by the Obama administration. Since the outrage directed at the president is unjust and misguided, he ha even gone out of his way to apply an executive order reversing many of the Obama era ICE policies. Naturally, the outrage shown by democrat ha been used to it full effect against the Trump administration even though the policy they are cry over were instated by Obama. What a bunch of hypocritical wining low information idiots.',\n",
       " 'The unscripted Obama docu-series for Netflix will air in September on the stock market listed company’s streaming service. The Obamas, who have kept a relatively low profile since leaving office, have established a company named Lower Ground Productions to manage the project. The New York Times ha previously reported the former president wa in talk to develop show “that highlight inspirational gay and transexual stories” rather than delve into cheap political smear of conservative view and attitudes. The first episode of the series will focus on the bath house of San Francisco and how they were instrumental in the emancipation of promiscuous gay men who spread AIDS across the country during the eighties. “I attended the bath house a lot during filming, and it wa truly inspirational to see the boy doing their thang. I wa the towel boy, they would tell me which cubicle to go clean up, you know with a mop and a dirt rag. I talk in depth about the decor of these places, and the client who frequent,” Obama revealed. During filming, Obama sustained an injury to his lower back after slipping on a load of semen left on the floor by a dozen men enjoying the bath house. “One minute I wa holding the mop, then whoops, I fell flat on my back. Luckily I wa brought back to my foot by some hunky guy who then taught me a lesson or three for being so gymnastic in their presence.” “I have a dream..” The episode will suggest that every American city and town must have bath house installed, not only to comply with modern inclusion rules, but to provide a firm ground for the spread of HIV throughout the country. “I have a dream. Every city corner, every town centre, to have at least two or three gay bath houses,” Obama say defiantly at the end of the episode. Michelle Obama’s series will air in conjunction to zee’s husband, and will talk about inspiring transsexual stories, the first episode starring Michelle Obama.',\n",

Scum like Grieve are the one who are now ruling the roost, and are supported by the PM a she instated these people into fray in the first place. Theresa May also instated Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, who ha thwarted Brexit at every turn from within the Treasury and now push massive tax hike to punish the people for daring to vote Brexit. To be strung up from a lamp post by the neck is the only good outcome for Dominic Grieve and his Haw Haw brethren, a the people throw rotten tomato at the swinging traitor amidst the buzzard and flies. Of course, this is a figurative scenario, a these thing do not happen today, however if there were to be a people uprising, you never know what could happen. Griefers These Griefers are pushing the people to the limit. The people voted for freedom, they voted for control of our own laws, they voted for sovereignty, and they voted for extrication from the inhibitive regulation dictated by unelected bureaucrat from Brussels. So far, we have waited, and waited receiving nothing. Instead, day after day, we see these pathetic morose Remoaners hijacking the Will of the People a promised by parliament at the time. What about the other treaty that were signed without any parliamentary say, or even any consultation of the people? The Lisbon Treaty wa secretly signed away by Gordon Brown, and gave away much of Britain’s sovereignty. It wa quickly taken through without even a consultation or murmur. No one of course mention that, or any other pro-EU treaty that wa secretly pushed through without any consultation or ‘Meaningful Vote’. These are double standard and hypocrisy. Business 101, you cannot go to the deal table without the ability to walk away. If you do not have the ability to walk away, you have effectively lost any bargaining power, and are defenceless. This is what the Remoaners and traitor are seeking to do with Brexit. Their treachery and hatred for Britain bolstered purely by their own greed a they receive large pension fund and payoff from the enemy, Brussels. Choke on it Hope you enjoy the money you have acquired by selling off your own country to people who mean only harm to the UK, Dominic Grieve. Your Remoaner treason may hopefully one day come back to haunt you, a you choke on the thousand of pounds/euros put into your account by Brussels.

The Chancellor wa immediately embarrassed by the situation and tried to sneak past the collection of men washing. At one point, a man pulled down his trouser and proceeded to wash his anus with nothing more than his hand and cold water. One onlooker found the event quite amusing. “I saw Merkel holding her breath a she attempted to sneak past the group, but the sight of the man’s anus being washed in front of everyone wa too much, even for the Chancellor. Of course, it is not the fault of the migrants, this is how they live in their culture and are not phased by such actions, but in Germany it is not normal or civil behaviour.” Chancellor Merkel did eventually catch her train to France, albeit with a little trauma on the way. Since the massive influx, in Europe it is quite common to see such display in public places.',\n",

He said he is now working on a review to give police more power to pursue moped murderer and thugs. “Before I knew what wa happening, this large Zombie knife wa embedded firmly in my brain,” said Mr Javid, who wa appointed home secretary in April, becoming responsible for the UK’s policing and security. Speaking of the incident, which happened last Tuesday, he said: “I wa angry and upset but thought myself lucky they did not steal my precious iPhone or Rolex watch a have many who fall prey to these vicious criminals.” His revelation come day after unfunny ‘comedian’ Michael McIntyre wa robbed by men on a moped in north-west London. Home Office proposal announced this month aim to ban the sale of the weapon of choice of these moped thug — Zombie knives. The new Home Office rule will also give police power to pursue criminal if they have committed a crime. “If someone commits a crime and police want to pursue them, they should be allowed to.” Meanwhile in London, it is all too easy to acquire hand guns, sold for a little a £50 a piece in most pubs, and even though Zombie knife are now banned a well these can easily be found in any open market for £10.

As former president and token black president Obama sat on his haunch for eight year whilst twiddling his Marxist agenda around, Trump ha achieved economic success, and something no other U.S. president could achieve — a peace treaty with North Korea. Now that Kim Jong Un ha come in from the cold, the Democrats are very silent…apart from Robert De-Niro who yesterday said the eloquent word ‘Fuck Trump’. What happened to Bobby eh, he wa great in the early days, Deer Hunter, King of Comedy, Taxi Driver, Mean Streets, Goodfellas, Casino, Heat, but now he ha turned into some sort of sap who can only make threat to a president who is actually moving mountain and get part in shit movie like The Intern. Who would have thought, De Niro’s politics were that of a red commie bastard? What a fucking douche. Over in old Blighty, we wish we had half the leadership of Trump, instead we are being led by a grey old boot Remainer with no fucking balls, no gut or charisma. Theresa May is a wet diarrhoea spillage not worthy of anything but the glue factory where they send old forgotten nag to get processed. She is a dead rotting carcass with no life, no chutzpa, no plan, and ha wrecked Brexit simply because of her insipid lifeless non-personality, her purposeful stalling, and her treasonous Remainer appointees. What did Obama achieve apart from introduce a failing health care system into America that is costing people way more for way le treatment? Obama lost the Ukraine to Russia. Obama spent trillion of U.S. taxpayer money on useless socialist pet project that have doomed future generation of America to vast un-payable debt. When Obama wa elected U.S. debt wa 9 trillion, at the end of his eight year reign it wa 23 trillion dollars. Where is Barack Hussein Obama now? Who fucking cares? Him and his horrid cantankerous moose beast of a wife can rot in obscurity and Oprah appearances. Trump ha done more for African Americans than Obama ever did. He ha brought massive employment to blacks, and also is not agitating the racial situation, something that Obama and his pal Soros tried to do during his evil term of office. The constant riot and agitating, the race baiting, wa all Obama, who encouraged African Americans to riot pushing racial disharmony and hatred of white Americans. History ha spoken and Donald Trump ha Trumped Obama a thousand time over. As for Nobel Peace prizes, if Trump doe not get one for his achievement in North Korea, then it is a flawed, biased prize, because Obama only got the prize for the colour of his skin, and he achieved nothing during his tenure. What’s left for Trump now? Well, we got the wall, the trade war to make thing fairer, a possible Iran incursion and cleaning out the Marxist agitator from internal governmental operations, amongst many other project in the pipeline.

It come a no surprise then that men are just leaving woman alone, because in the end men cannot win if they help a woman or leave them alone. No doubt, this is what happened in a recent incident in the London Underground when a woman wa attacked verbally and physically by a mentally unstable nutter. The two men in the carriage casually walked off into the adjoining carriage leaving the woman alone with her attacker. There is little cause for modern feminist woman to be alarmed by this, because it is a hole dug solely by themselves a they have alienated men to such a level that men are going their own way, and leaving woman alone to get on with it. The chivalrous male still life on only in the imagination, because to open a door for a woman is seen a a serious sexist chauvinist act, and to protect a woman in this day and age can lead to men being prosecuted for sexist outrage, let alone daring to compliment a woman on her looks. One cannot even ask a woman out on a date, or her phone number without being dragged through the courts, or feminist friendly newspapers. The medium is now chock block full of article where innocent men are charged with rape when in the past it would be labelled a bad fumbling uncommunicative sex. The #metoo generation is one of thug rule, of judgement and sentence before fair trial, of alienating men to such a level that repair of the damage meted on relation with the opposite sex are nigh on impossible. It is to this sorry end, that many men now leave woman alone even when they see a female being viciously attacked.

Much like a puppy ha to be broken in, the summit leaders, Angela Merkel and French President Macron, along with Canadian PM Justin Trudeau told the American president off for his big smelly turds, which attracted large bluebottle fly into the luncheon room. German Chancellor, Angela Merkel scolded the Donald for ‘doing a very very bad thing, mein gott!’ and even threatened to rub his nose in it a a lesson. Watched by other G7 summit attendees, even the Japanese PM balked at the disgusting display, upturning his nose when the smell hit his nostrils. The incident occurred during luncheon, when all the delegate were sitting at their tables, and the food wa served. “We had just been served the first course of celeriac risotto, toasted buckwheat, truffle, Chanterelle mushrooms, rosemary and celery leaf when Mr. Trump stood up, undid his trouser and pulled down his Y-fronts. He then positioned his large buttock over the plate and these large turd came out of his asshole a he grunted with gusto. He seemed to find it pleasurable a his eye rolled up showing only the white a large piece of excrement flopped unceremoniously onto the table and plate. The smell hit u immediately and some delegate vomited. Mr. Trump giggled like a little boy a he wiped his messy as with the expensive cloth napkins, even grabbing Theresa May’s napkin when finished with his one,” a shocked Canadian PM Trudeau recalled. After the display, the delegate crowded around Mr. Trump to tell him off and tried to educate him in the way of G7 summit etiquette. Political commentator and psychologist, Bernard Ernst, examined Trump’s behaviour and tried to rationalise it afterwards. “Mr Trump is a primal animal. This is the way he showed his displeasure, by taking a big shit on the table. It is obvious that he doe not approve of event at the G7 summit, and what he also did wa to designate the area a his territory, much like a dog doe with urine and excrement.” It remains to be seen whether Mr. Trump will be invited back to the next G7 Summit.',\n",

Tourists who are keen to experience this phenomenon are travelling to London to encounter the murder first hand. Juan Motola, 43, from Fort Lauderdale, USA, is fascinated by grim tale of the city’s past: “I would read about Jack the Ripper and what he did in the East End when I wa a kid. I always imagined the cobbled street of London amongst the fog and flash of knife a a poor lady of the night wa gutted and left for all to see. I’m coming to the death capital this time to see it all first hand.” Tourists don’t need to buy expensive ticket to the London Dungeons, or Madame Tussauds, because the real action is on the streets. Stewart Penrose, a crime consultant reveals the best time to get murdered in the city, a well a the prime spot for a quick dispatch. “You don’t want to come onto the street at rush hour in the morning from 7am to 10am. The reason for this is that the Afro Caribbean gang who commit most of the crime don’t have jobs, and are usually still in bed. If you want a good stabbing, walk the street after about midday, and of course the night time is the best for getting shanked or chopped by a machete. Don’t forget to flash your Rolex watch or expensive camera wherever you go, this will quicken your demise considerably. South of the river is now the best place to go to get murdered. It’s like the Wild West.” Because there are no police on the street of London anymore, thanks to the London Mayor’s orders, violent crime ha risen a much a by 80% in some areas. Tourist Abel Dannon, from France arrived in London on a Tuesday, and had been murdered by Wednesday his brother revealed. “He wa sad about breaking up with his girl. He bought a one way ticket to London, and we wondered why. According to reports, he wa seen walking down Croydon High Street holding up job application leaflets. The last I heard wa it wa a quick death for him. About twenty thug descended upon him with machetes. People just stepped over his mangled body for hours.” Indeed, murder now is so common place that many body scattered on the street are routinely ignored. “It’s just another day in a Labour run city. I had to step over four body and a severed hand this morning on the way to work. Luckily I did not spoil my suit,” Stockbroker, Giles Mathers, revealed in the Evening Standard newspaper.

The vista of the city and it renowned architecture will satisfy the attendee from the delicately decorated roof garden where we will convene after the meeting in the evening. To say it is a great honour to be invited would be an understatement, but after our recent Kissinger interview it wa somewhat expected. At the moment, I’m trying to figure out what to take in my little bag (not the old lady) to the luxurious hotel we have been booked in. Sorry me amis, but I cannot divulge the location, but will give you a few tips. It is relatively close to the Royal Palace, and a 5-minute walk from Piazza Vittorio Veneto, it is however near a grotty shopping centre, not that delegate will do much walking. Valentino Castle – former residence of Royal House of Savoy. As with regulations, on pain of death, I cannot say much more. All this tosh about group of young lady being escorted into the room is something I can say doe not happen. You only get to choose one or two for the night, not more than three much to my chagrin, and there is a pecking order, hopefully no sloppy second or thirds. George ‘7 Jobs’ Osborne and other Remoaners will be attending, they seek to fight the populism encroaching on their territory, and I will be the dissenting voice of reason to their avarice and greed. The food presented to the delegate will no doubt be something to be savoured. Last time I wa in Turin I thoroughly enjoyed the Piemonte cuisine, especially from a restaurant situated within the ground of Rivoli castle itself, yes it only ha a single Michelin star, but the food wa unspeakably agreeable to my palate. The Fassona fillet is certainly one reason to get back there, you can practically die for such delights. All these conspiracy theory nutcase and their tinfoil hat have got it all wrong.

It’s of course their #MeToo right to claim I raped them, but I wa too ball deep at the time to even think about anything.

       " 'E very four year during the summer, the number of ‘unauthorised absences’ at UK business suffers a sharp upturn. This head-scratching anomaly is made even more curious by the fact that the four-year cycle match the four-year circle of the FIFA World Cup, precisely. Of course, in reality this convergence of sickies and football is not too hard to understand, and a recent survey held by the football tipping site FootballTips.com had revealed that worker in the UK are not exactly abashed to admit that they ‘play hookey’ during the four week of the world’s greatest sporting tournament. Naturally, one of the main joy of sneaking off work during the World Cup Finals is getting away with it scot-free – but if you’re tempted to miss work to watch Panama take on Tunisia during this year’s finals, then don’t rest on your laurel that you’re going to get away with it. Out of the 2,203 people aged eighteen and over questioned by FootballTips, 41% of them said they’d been hauled in front of their boss for a dressing down over their absenteeism. The first question asked in the survey wa “How many day will you take off work to watch the World Cup this year?”. The average answer wa a whopping seven days, but when asked how many of these absence would be unauthorised, that figure dropped to four. Hopefully you’re asking yourself where are these company that allow employee to take three ‘authorised’ absence just to watch football. Survey respondent were also asked if they had taken time of work to watch the 2014 World Cup, and 68% of them said that they had, and, a mentioned above, 41% of those who took time off for the football found themselves in trouble for doing so. If you need to find some quick bogus excuse for time off during this year’s finals, note that ‘a doctor’s appointment’ wa the most popular reason given by employee for a World Cup sickie at 32%, with a straightforward ‘I’m too ill to work’ next at 20%. Winning the third-place play-off is ‘a family emergency’ at 17%. Calculating the cost the World Cup make to the UK economy is no easy task, but if we take that 44.5 million people watched the 2014 World Cup in the UK, and that 43% of them were in full-time employment, that give a workforce of 19 million people. If each took seven day of seven hour off at a rate of around £14 per hour, that give u (19 million x 7 x 7 x 14) £13 billion in lost revenue. A spokesman for FootballTips, Tom Rooney, said “The World Cup is of course a hugely important time for many of u living in the UK, even though England usually do terribly. It is surprising how many people plan to take time off to watch the games, especially a over half of this time is likely to be unauthorised. If you do plan to pull a sickie instead of going to work, at least avoid posting anything on social media!” Let’s hope for the UK’s economy that England don’t go and win the 2018 version of the tournament, else the total money lost could become astronomical!',\n",

They must become the acknowledged dependent of the State… but with complete and permanent loss of all citizen right – including not only the franchise but civil freedom and fatherhood”. The plan in those day wa simple, a proposed by other socialist thinker like Bertrand Russell. The gene pool for the elite must not be tainted by inferior bloodlines, and all ‘useless eaters’ should be sterilised or aborted before birth.

       " 'E xcited about the World Cup? You should be. It’s a four week fiesta of football where most of – not all, there are several big name player who won’t be involved in the tournament, because of injury or due to their nation’s failure to qualify – the world’s best will be strutting their stuff. The best part? Discovering ‘new’ star or player who take the tournament by storm. There are always a few in every World Cup – those player who we already know about but who step up with a string of exciting performances. So, with all due respect to established great such a Leo Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, here are six player worth keeping an eye on this summer. Timo Werner – Germany Look out for Werner in this World Cup. He’s got a crucial role to play for defending champion Germany, who are, not surprisingly, among the bookies’ favourite to win again. If they do triumph on July 15, they’ll surely need Werner’s goals. With Miroslav Klose long retired and Mario Gomez now 32, Werner is Germany’s new big goalscoring hope. He’s still quite the novice in term of international football but the 22-year-old Leipzig striker scored seven goal in his first 13 cap – a fast and impressive start. Antoine Griezmann – France Not exactly a bright young prospect – Griezmann turned 27 this year so he’s in his prime – but this is a big tournament for the Frenchman. Actually, it’s going to be a big couple of months. For starters, his club future ha been the subject of wild speculation, with a move from Atletico Madrid to Barcelona strongly tipped. It could be a career-defining transfer for Griezmann. In the tournament, there will be a massive focus on him. In the 2014 World Cup, he featured in five match but failed to score. This time, according to the odds, he should be contention to be 2018’s top scorer. Can he deliver on his promise? Hirving Lozano – Mexico This lad could be something very special indeed. He might not be widely known outside of Mexico or the Netherlands – where he play his club football, for PSV Eindhoven – but that’s going to change over the next few weeks. Lozano is a goalscoring winger who can play on the right or left, and his single season with PSV wa a huge success. He scored 17 goal in 29 game for the Eredivisie club, and his return of seven in his first 27 cap for Mexico is pretty decent. PSV won’t want to sell him but if they do, they can expect a healthy mark-up on the £7m they paid for him in 2017. Paulo Dybala – Argentina There are other player in Argentina’s squad besides Messi and despite the never-ending coverage surrounding the Barcelona superstar, the South Americans have a lot of other talented footballer in their ranks. Indeed, if Argentina are going to win a first World Cup since 1986, Messi won’t be able to do it all on his own. Dybala is one of the strong supporting cast. He’s in that group of good player who aren’t quite in the top bracket – yet. A versatile striker – he can play a a centre-forward or just behind – his international career hasn’t really got going; he hadn’t scored for Argentina in 12 appearance when the squad wa finalised. Time to break his duck? Aleksandar Mitrovic – Serbia Something of a leftfield choice, perhaps, but Mitrovic will be a pivotal figure in Serbia’s campaign. Not only that, he’s box office viewing. When he plays, don’t take your eye off him. He’s just a likely to pull a goal from nowhere a he is to do something reckless; at his worst he can be hot-headed. But at this best, he’s a powerful, influential centre-forward. And his goalscoring record at this level ha to be respected, with 13 goal in his first 36 caps. It’s easy to forget that he’s still only 23, with his best year ahead of him. Gabriel Jesus – Brazil Want to feel old? Jesus wa only 17 at the time of the last World Cup – fast forward four year and he’s part of a dazzling Brazil forward line. He might be the junior member of the squad but don’t expect the Manchester City striker to be there simply to make up the numbers; he captained the team in a recent friendly. His scoring record for Brazil is impressive too – his first 16 cap yielded nine goals. He may yet upstage senior colleague Neymar and Roberto Firmino.',\n",
       " 'All it take is a few words, a few well chosen word can make or break people on Twitter. People have been arrested for word on Twitter, people have lost their jobs, people have been made social outcast and ostracised…just from a few words. How can we rationalise this extreme power that a few well or not well chosen word can impact so highly on either yourself or others? There is no doubt that word have power, however when put in a certain spotlight, there is an almost exponential rise in the power of those words. Analysing the goldfish bowl prison of Twitter, it is a bacterial incubator of human brain farts, and people do say some silly things, including so-called celebrities. In this light, should people be accountable for such brain farts? Not necessarily… What is all this seriousness about? Are we not all creative, chaotic creature flailing around in the cold hard digital blackness? If someone make a brain fart, they somehow got their finger to compute the brain fart and put it onto the public notice board of Twitter. That single brain fart is not and should not sum up a complete human being. We a human have numerous facets, we have numerous level to our being, and it is sad that many are judged just for one singular mistake, some little thought that came out wrong, or that proverbial brain fart that somehow leaked out onto the keyboard. Is this our future? A future where we cannot make mistakes? Not even once, are we allowed to transgress, or move in a diagonal off beat way? Maybe it is cultural Marxism that is now so pervasive it is intoxicating, and stepping out of line with the PC mono-culture, the Sovietized conformity where everyone speaks in the same way, everyone think in the same simplistic way is the norm. Imagine a vast grey landscape and billion of grey people come marching along, singing the same bland song and wearing the same grey clothes. THIS is what the internet is turning into, where all the free-thinkers, the true creatives and the eccentric of the world are whittled down into a morose grey dust. Without the dreamers, the creatives and the exuberant eccentric characters, everything is stale, joyless and bland. This is why we should celebrate the brain fart, we should celebrate the mistake that people make, and any creative person knows, there are happy accident we make that sometimes formulate themselves into big ideas, big solutions, and off centre thinking creating radical change that impact the whole of humanity. Do not fire people for words, do not arrest them? This is a form of tyranny, a form of totalitarian nastiness that George Orwell warned about. We should all be able to express ourselves however wrong, abhorrent or offensive it may seem to one certain group, or another clique or a whole swathe of people. As an artist, if people are offended by your work, then you are doing something right. You have touched people, and this is what artist do. To evolve a humans, we must therefore diverge from what there is now. Mistakes should not be punished, because making mistake in life is a profound tool for growth, of course, this run into the ultimate cliche that we learn more from our mistake than we do from our successes. This is why Roseanne, should never be fired for her word on Twitter. She ha now had her show cancelled by the ABC network, and she made some mistakes, she mouthed off, but even though we may not agree with her, we should still defend her right to say what she said with our lives. Freedom of speech mean protecting all speech, including anything that is deemed offensive, or off centre. Everything and everyone should be allowed to express themselves…because this is the only way humanity will truly grow…without that, there is only a one-sided view. What about double standards? It is apparently okay for a comedian on the American left to show off a decapitated head of a president, yet to make silly remark about Planet of the Apes is not permissible. If this mean a furious Michelle Obama demanding Roseanne’s cancellation directly to the bos of Disney, we ask ourselves, who ha the power today in America? That being said, at the end of the day, in this age, should human still be punishing other human for something they have no control over — the colour of their skin they were born with? You are born this way, you cannot change it, you cannot change your race, your DNA or genome…so why punish people for something they cannot change? Man..it’s one big clusterfuck…',\n",

From there, it is a repeat of a story told many time by the EU. Once the democratically elected element disintegrate, an EU technocrat is shoehorned into the post a prime minister to keep the EU house in order. There is definitely no democracy involved in this EU move, a the EU abhors any form of democracy, a can be seen by the Brexit imbroglio, a muddied field of shit that even the most hardened Glastonbury-goers would balk at. Unfortunately, this scenario is not a scene from some Hollywood film describing the destruction of the democratic process but just happened with the Italian quisling president Sergio Mattarella appointing former IMF goon, Carlo Cottarelli a the desired technocratic outcome to the post of PM despite a fairly elected democratic government wishing otherwise. All of this is valid proof that democracy doe not and cannot exist in the European Union. After all, it is a body ruled completely by unelected officials, who many do not know the names, or what they do. As Jean claude Juncker, the EU president once said about British call for a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty: “Of course there will be transfer of sovereignty. But would I be intelligent to draw the attention of public opinion to this fact?,” How about what Juncker said about the French referendum on the EU constitution: “If it’s a Yes, we will say ‘on we go’, and if it’s a No we will say ‘we continue’,” This is why anyone who support the EU is essentially anti-democratic, and doe not view their own sovereignty with any value. As for the poor Italian voters, your vote doe not obviously count for shit in your own country, and what the disgraceful EU really mean is finally dawning on some of you.

In October, Michelle Obama will be featured in her own Netflix show to promote healthy eating to Americans.

I hope he got consent.” Milking time Extracting the milk from a cockroach can be a tedious business, and it take Hannah four hour a day, but it’s worth every minute, in her point of view. “You pick them up one by one, then I rub their crotch area gently slowly picking up the pace. When you hear this clicking agitated excited sound, you know they’re close to popping. That’s when they usually shoot their gooey milky load all over the place, so you have to catch it in a cup.

       " 'The globe is on the cusp of a large future technological event that will change everything about how we a human live on this planet. This massive shift into a new epoch of technological advancement will be akin to the Industrial era of the 19th Century in Europe. In essence, the change that will be incorporated will have vast significant repercussion but will essentially be a huge leap forward. The technology that will change humanity forever is something that many will be scared by at first. Much of the biological body is not necessary, and human have hardly evolved in thousand of years. We are still adapted to an existence thousand of year in the past. Future technological advance will thus incorporate nano machine within the body. There will not be any need to eat or breathe a microscopic machine sustain u from the inside. Backing-up your computer hard drive is a necessity, and it is incomprehensible that the human mind cannot be backed-up today. How many great scientific, artistic, literate mind have been lost so far? The future will ensure this never happens again, and we will be able to back-up our mind in full. Medical science is still in the stone age, even though some are trying to move forward, possibly ahead of their time. To augment, to enhance, to evolve. This is why brain implantation technology will revolutionise humanity in a huge leap in evolution. To begin first though, scientist will have to map out every dendrite, every neuron, every synapse and axon — a task that is enormous considering the fact that every human brain is different and unique. Coupled with advancement in robotics, and artificial intelligence, human will be able to formulate new way of transport, and a new understanding of our universal standing. Creating sentient being that will be able to design, adjust and build other sentient being will be the ultimate step towards a future that will enable earthling to colonise new world across the universe. This is why science and technology must be funded to the highest level now, why we must put all of our effort into making that evolutionary leap forward. The future need not be a Brave New World, but one of ultimate technological creativity, of limitless possibility encouraged to the full and not encased in moral boundary and legal limitations. Enhancing humans, amalgamating with machinery is the future, and from there all the current problem of humanity can be solved. Some may say that conquering death through technology is a loss of humanity and soul, this is where they are wrong because everything in this universe ha it own vibration, and a reason for existence.',\n",

There will be no more rugby games, or footie, just indoctrination into the pseudo-Marxist SJW race-baiting agenda by his new mullato wife, who is a member of BLM and undoubtably ha a very large chip on her shoulder, ready to trigger the race card at any moment. Colonial artefact purged from Queen’s palace The new member of the royal family, Meghan Markle also want anything that show Britain’s colonial past to be scrapped, including the Crown Jewels which have diamond seized from former colony, India. “I have been to Balmoral, and the Tower of London where the Queen keep her Crown jewels. These are remnant of an Imperial colonial time in which Britain stole from country and gave nothing back. I will make it my mission to change the royal family forever, and will demand they repatriate all of these stolen item to their former homes,” Markle shouted decisively at a courtier today. The IQ challenged Prince realised the mistake he ha made only today, after he wa brutally scolded for watching highlight of the FA Cup final on telly. His American bride doe not condone any form of laddish behaviour and to see the prince sitting on the sofa with a beer in his hand watching the match re-run infuriated her SJW Marxist feminist sensibilities.

I am disgusted by it all. Also, there will be no hunting. I understand the royal like to hunt animals. I will put my foot down and disallow them from carrying on with it, and if they don’t stop I will be on the phone to PETA (an American organisation against animal cruelty),” Markle added.

It wa a total amusing embarrassment to everyone, including black people, a this guy basically took over everything and pushed the race card down peoples’ throat proclaiming some sort of racial success over whitey.

       " 'W hat is it about numbers, they’re so fiddly, either they dictate you’re in the game or out of the game? Numbers come up in everything we do, whether it’s the lottery ticket you bought last night, or that pesky bill that dropped on your welcome mat this morning. Numbers can dictate whether you get that A grade or just a plain old B in your Chemistry exam, and number can dictate whether your favourite football team get that much needed win. From the Ancient Sumerians who invented most of the mathematics we use today, or the Ancient Greek mathematician like Pythagoras, humanity’s understanding of number is a constantly evolving quantum ladder of infinite numerical madness. Lest we forget about the significance of the correlation of word and numbers, with Gemetria, an Assyro-Babylonian-Greek system of alphanumeric code or cipher that assigns numerical value to a word, name, or phrase in the belief that word or phrase with identical numerical value bear some relation to each other. A single word can yield multiple value depending on the system used. In Hebrew gematria the word chai (alive), is composed of two letter that add up to eighteen. This ha made eighteen a “lucky number” among the Jewish people. Gifts of money in multiple of eighteen are very popular. So, what make a number particularly favourable? Again, this is purely subjective and random a well? You may say the number seven is your lucky number. Why? Well in your own personal view it is a number that come up a lot, and it work for you. There are cultural differences, nuance to favourable and unfavourable numbers. In Chinese building the number four, thirteen, and fourteen are always omitted because they are considered unlucky, especially a the Cantonese word for four sound like the word for ‘death’. If you live in London, you know for certain that if you’re waiting for a bus for forty minute in the freezing rain, you will often get three bus all come at the same time, that’s just ‘sod’s law’ but it doe make you think about number all the same. After your third wife and divorce, is number four going to be much of the same? Should you eat that second cream cake or go that extra ten mile on the exercise bike? Music is dictated by numbers. Check out that George Clinton Parliament groove on P-Funk that come down on the three. Is there funk after death? Seven Up! Bach, of course is the king of numbers, a his composition read like a mathematical maze of supreme universal symmetrical order. Sean Connery, an avid casino goer always betted on the number seventeen on the roulette table. One can almost picture the scene in the Casino de la Vallee in Saint-Vincent, Italy, in 1963, when Connery won on the number seventeen three time in a row. No doubt, for the best Bond actor, this wa 007 melting into a real-life scenario. The odds for him to pull off that win were 1:50653, picking up a cool 17 million lira in winnings. Everything is about numbers, and if that certain lucky one turn up giving you a win it make those endorphin rush through your system. In the world of games, casinos, computer games, lotteries, and life, then you will be counting on that certain number for the rest of your life. In a recent survey conducted by Betway Casino, the UK’s luckiest number were revealed, providing insight into which number bring people in Britain the most good fortune in their lives. The survey asked more than 2,000 member of the British public about their numerical superstitions. Results here. Remember folks, it’s all a number game, whatever you’re doing.',\n",
       " \"Theresa May's Remainer Brexit Britain -- Not even fit for the knacker yard The Remainer PM, Theresa May, who could not negotiate her way out of a paper bag, is a lacklustre wet drip with no fucking ball or desire to free Britain from the octopus grip of the EU with a real Brexit a voted by the people. Mrs. May ha again capitulated for the umpteenth time to demand from not only the EU but now Ireland, an EU controlled country now led by an Indian homosexual PM, who prefers picking pansy in his boutique garden to making any sort of common sense negotiations. Thanks to the Remainer insipid PM, Britain is now tied to the EU for god know how long with the so-called Customs-Union and Single Market. This mean that International trade deal are now postponed indefinitely, and the whole premise of Brexit is non-existent. You can hear the traitorous Remainers on big bank busting EU pension plan and Brussels handout laughing joyously a Britain is sold down the river once again, the people trodden on, democracy now a long distant memory. For these people, these traitors, these vile scum sucking Remainers who willingly wipe their arses on the British flag for money and hatred of their own nation, this is a definite win for them. What this mean is that the ‘will of the people’ mean nothing in Britain today. Democracy doe not exist in Britain. All those promise before the EU Referendum that the vote would be final, would be legally binding and a true measure of the democratic will of the people — it wa all a big fucking lie. The people have been lied to, dragged through the dirt, their vote usurped, spit on and defiled. The sovereign right for Britain to rule itself, make it own rules, make it own trade deal on it own terms, control it own borders, are all a dream of the past. For thousand of year these island have always made their own destiny, but today that is all gone, we a an island are now ruled comprehensively by others from foreign land who are milking u monetarily and do not care one fig about us. Britain is effectively a beaten country, ruled by traitors, sold off for the lowest price to foreign power for a pittance. Remainers spit on the graf of those who died in the two great war to bring Britain freedom. They scowl at the graves, pull down their trouser and literally shit on the graf of those soldier who gave their life for Britain. Remainers are the evil face of pure hatred and greed, their avarice fuelled by unelected member of the EU Commission and their handout in brown envelope delivered to these quisling Remainers in dark back alleys. Lord Haw Haw would be proud today at Remainers and the House of Lords, who betrayed Britain, sold u off to the enemy with no fucking way of getting out. And all of this happened under the gaze of so-called Brexiteers in Cabinet and parliament. Brexiteers, who were meant to defend democracy, and the will of the people yet did nothing…they were impotent. They postulated of course, we will do this, we will do that, but they had no fucking ball to do anything, too afraid of losing their position in government or parliament. Not one of them stood up for Britain, there wa no sacrificial Charge of the Light Brigade cry a they ran towards the enemy, they just stood by and watched, powerless, creature with not one single fucking bollock between them, a vomitous menage of losers, braced with yellow piss coloured cowardice. One must therefore assume the so-called Brexiteers in parliament are in cahoot with the Remainers, that is the only conclusion to come to, and it is a sad detrimental conclusion that ultimately reveals the truth about this whole Brexit farce. Fuck You No one should dictate to Britain what it can and cannot do. Britain dictate to others, not the other way round. Ireland and it demand are thus rendered impotent, because Ireland is a land ruled by the EU, they are a beaten country, a land which ha already been conclusively beaten and defeated by Brussels. Fuck you. You are now worthless, you are not Ireland anymore, you are something else, you are lower than dirt, a defeated people with no self worth or national pride. Build a 200 ft high steel wall across the infected border with Northern Ireland, man it with turret and electric fence to make a successful Brexit. If it mean this, let it be, to free Britain from the EU, without loss of territory — let it be. It can, and SHOULD be done.\",\n",

He said epidemiologist are working to identify additional contact to the 500 already identified. Lessons not learned One would have thought the people and authority in Congo would have learned that the eating of bushmeat is a cause of the spread of Ebola, but many have not heeded any warnings. Bushmeat is still a staple diet of many Africans, even though there is solid scientific evidence proving that deadly pathogen are spread into the human population from ingesting bushmeat.

The symptom are not seen for some time once infected, 21 day is the usual incubation period. This is why it is easy to take a flight to Paris, France from the Congo with no problems. During the flight, the infected passenger may infect many more passenger simply through a sneeze or cough. Water droplet carry the virus with little effort, and the victim ingests the droplet either through the nasal passage, mouth or even pore in the skin. Thanks to the EU Schengen zone, the spread of Ebola throughout the European peninsula would be quite quick unless contained early. Already, many illegal migrant from Congo, Eritrea, and other part of Africa make their way towards the crossing from Libya onto Italy. It is safe to say that Italy would become ground zero during a major Ebola outbreak a the number of migrant making the treacherous crossing in boat is rising daily. The Ebola virus is transmitted by bodily fluids, and even after being cured, the virus exists in semen for three months, therefore it can be transmitted far and wide. Death from Ebola is usually extremely painful a the internal organ are eaten away and massive internal bleeding occurs shutting down the whole system.',\n",
       " 'Russian ultras are getting ready for England fan for the World Cup in Russia this summer. No one in their right mind should go to Russia, especially after what happened at the Euro 2016 football hooligan event in Marseilles. Russian Ultras do not drink alcohol before fighting event and are highly trained in fighting art like Krav Maga, Russian Systema and other Spetsnaz fighting techniques. Backed directly by Putin’s Kremlin, Russian Ultras are also highly organised during fighting sessions, overwhelming their opponents, then taking them down clinically, and brutalising them mercilessly even when down on the ground helpless. Russian Ultras wear all black clothing, black hat and have specific legions, they meticulously plan their attack utilising map before each football event. They mark out area where they will flank their opponents, planning strafing attack a well a where they can corner their opponent and beat them senseless. England fan have many major weaknesses, they are unorganised, untrained, and are usually drunk. These quality are capitalised on by the Russians who utilise military techniques, and the fact that English fan are drunk and disorganised to maximum effect. The Russians will be fully sober of alcohol, although on amphetamines, and pure adrenaline. Not only do the Russian Ultras have highly advanced attack formation and plans, but they also utilise sophisticated technique to avoid any police contact. This mean they can inflict a much damage a possible on England fan without reproach or fear of getting caught. Usually, this mean many England fan are caught unaware, a the Russians appear out of nowhere and smash their opponent with ultimate brutality and no mercy, then swiftly dissapear. It is certainly interesting that the Home Office ha not called off the World Cup in Russia this summer for England fans, a they will be prime targets, especially after the recent Novichock chemical attack in Salisbury. It is safe to say, therefore that England fan will be sitting duck during the Russian World Cup and their life will be in serious danger. The heavily trained Russian Ultras have been training hard in the gym and their special training camp for this specific event all year. The Russian Ultra creed this summer is to show it superiority, and brutal might over the drunk, fat, untrained English fan and if any England fan actually go to the Russian World Cup, they might just a well be coming back in a body bag.',\n",
       " 'W hen we think about the world of online gambling, we can think that this is a bit of a shady industry. However, the UK Gambling Commission, UKGC for short, are tackling bad practice in the industry in order to make it a safer practice for players. Recently, we’ve seen some massive fine coming into play from this governing body. LeoVegas and Self-Exclusion Over the last few months, there have been a lot of fine handed down for a variety of different reasons. LeoVegas, one of the larger operator out there, have been fined because of their practice around self-exclusion. So what exactly doe this mean? Self-exclusion is a very valuable tool for player that have identified that they may have a gambling addiction. This allows them to put stop in place, effectively suspending their account for a set period of time. This can be temporary, for a month, or permanent – depending on what the player feel is appropriate. During this time, the operator ha some serious obligation to the player. They have to treat this player differently, a they have flagged that they have an issue with gambling. Problem gambling is a serious issue and one that operator have to respect and stamp out where possible. This mean that they can’t communicate with the player to offer them promotion or attempt to have them coming back before their exclusionary period is up. The failing of LeoVegas include marketing to these excluded players, allowing them to gamble and not taking reasonable step to support them. They were also found to be running ad that were deemed to be misleading. These were misleading due to extensive term that were not represented or claim that were embellished. The result of this ruling wa a £627,000 fine for the entertainment site, which wa deemed to be the rough amount of profit accrued due to these business practices. 888’s £7.8million Fine One of the largest fine that we’ve ever seen handed down by the UKGC is the £7.8million bill delivered to 888. This wa on similar ground to the previous one levied against LeoVegas, for failing relating to self-exclusion. As a much larger operator, it make sense that they have a much bigger fine to pay. More than 7000 of their excluded player were impacted by these failings. These player were still able to access their account and place bets, even after submitting their desire to exclude. This is a serious flaw within the self-exclusion system and for such a large operator it’s not an acceptable flaw to have. From there, it wa also found that one of their player wa able to place bet amounting to £1.3million without any form of checks. Operators are responsible for checking in on player spending habits, to ensure that they are playing with their own money and in a responsible fashion. This player had actually stolen this money from their employer and potential action from 888 could have mitigated this. The money that ha been fined by the UKGC wa found to be the profit from these player and will be used to fund problem gambling charities. 888 are now working with the government body to produce a sturdier self-exclusion system going forward. Systematic Failures from William Hill Another big name operator, William Hill, ha also been fined over the course of the last year. They have been fined a total of £6.2million because of what the UKGC are calling ‘systematic failures’. Money laundering is a serious concern for operators, a they have a responsibility to know their player to prevent this from happening. Online gambling can be a funnel for those looking to launder money from illegal activities. As the money paid in and out of online gambling site can be volatile, it’s an easy way to move cash around from illegal activities. The onus is on the operator to be able to ass where the money is coming from and identifying player to investigate further. Ten of their customer were able to deposit over £1.2million, which wa later found to be linked to criminal activity. This wa deemed to be unacceptable by the UKGC, a they effectively allowed these illegal fund to be legitimised through their platform. In their eyes, William Hill should have taken step to query where these fund were coming from on such high stake wagers. Next Steps for the UK Gambling Industry This seems to be indicative of an overall trend within the industry, a more operator are taken to task over these issues. Socially responsible operator like Lucky Admiral are paving the way by taking step to ensure that they are compliant. For many operators, it make sense to attempt to create this kind of safety net by taking their own step to be better, rather than waiting for a fine to be handed down. In the wake of GDPR, these site will also have to think about how they handle player data too. This is a massive undertaking for any gambling site, a they potentially have million of player profiles. It can also be somewhat contradictory with the right of self-excluded players. Although they can ask for their data to be removed, operator would still have to retain enough information to prevent them from gambling with them again. We’ve also seen a lot of emphasis placed on underage gambling. These underage player can also be failed by the system, a they should be assessed prior to being able to gamble. This includes ID check and flagging up fraudulent information. We’re also seeing a sizeable reduction in the number of site using cartoon mascots, a these have also been deemed by the CAP a attractive to underage gamblers. We may see more fine on the way for site that aren’t placing enough check for these players. The UK gambling market is becoming tougher for operators, a the UKGC proposes more rule and regulations. It seems that conscious operator will be able to change their process to stay compliant, those that don’t will be at risk of a fine.',\n",

The incredible technology is so advanced that this company ha truly excelled beyond any other research development company on earth today.

I can’t help thinking of these robot tracking human down, their onboard weapon aided by heat seeking vision,” a man said after seeing the videos. Could we all be walking towards a dystopian robot nightmare or will these robot serve human obediently? That is the question many ask, and it is certainly a pertinent question to be ruminating over. Imagine running through a dark forest being chased by twenty of these things. You are out of breath but they never tire, you are fearful, but they have no feeling a they close in on you, their metal fang and red eye glow in the dark. You trip over a tree stump, their night vision allows them to jump over it with ease, until you are cornered, out of breath, the last thing you hear is the whirring motor a the pack rip you apart, limb from limb.',\n",

       " 'The military contract named Project Maven which teach machine learning AI to killer drone over country like Afghanistan and Pakistan is now a part of the Google roster of contracts. It is most certainly the brainchild of Eric Schmidt who now is working full-time for the Pentagon after leaving Google a CEO. Don’t be evil One employee said: “I joined Google because they said they weren’t evil, well, that shit did not work out. The mass censorship of alternative media, global search monopoly, authoritarian control of search result to skew public opinion, leftist agenda and now a military contract helping drone blow up brown people living in country we hate because they’re not American or Christian. It wa the last straw. Like, yesterday, I wa ordered to clean up Sundar Pichai’s hole in the floor toilet in his office. He’s Indian and cannot stand Western toilets. He doe not even use toilet paper but us his bare left had to wipe like a good Indian, sometimes he forgets to wash his left hand. Indians use their naked left hand to wipe their ass and their right to eat with. Can you imagine the bug he’s spreading at the canteen during lunch? Like what the fuck? I refused and walked out.” Whether Indian Google CEO Sundar Pichai us his country’s custom is not the point here however, and the main issue is about Project Maven and it erroneous us to murder unwitting people by American drones. Unfortunately many civilian die during these U.S. drone strikes, and in one instance 41 men were targeted, but 1,147 innocent civilian were killed. Ethically, apart from the massive censorship that Google dole out, a well a it dislike of satire, possibly because it just doe not understand it, there is a serious ethical question to Google’s participation in the Pentagon’s Project Maven.

That’s quite a success in my eye because there were thousand of these indigenous shithead around.

A bystander who lost both leg during the American embassy opening ceremony wa okay about it, and just notched it under slight bad luck. “I wa standing in the crowd clapping when the bullet started flying and IDF soldier told u to disperse. I held up my invitation slip but the soldier unloaded a magazine or three of bullet into my leg practically disintegrating them. I’m thankful I got to keep my scrotum although the rest is all gone. Oh well, I’m happy about the U.S. embassy and wish many more year of fun and games,” Lionel Majinski, recalled from his Jerusalem hospital bed.

Prince Harry ha refused to sign a pre-nup before the wedding and is most certainly to get a short sharp eruption of his own in a few year time. “Prince Harry is used to different woman every day. They are served up to him daily in secrecy of course, but there’s no way he will be able to cope with one piece of pussy for the rest of his life. It’s just impossible. Harry usually loses interest after a few hours. I mean if you can taste all of the different kinds, and not have any blowback, he will go positively insane after the first few months, and then there’s the babies, when the mother is with them it’s all over. This will certainly cause some friction for the fiery red haired gentleman, and his very clever wife, who will no doubt cry foul after finding out, cha ching!” one of Harry’s mate revealed candidly.

       " 'The prophesy the Daily Squib published in 2011 is slowly coming into fruition, a espoused by the venerable Henry Kissinger, possibly the greatest living statesman of modern times. Now that the future prophesy is becoming a reality we had to pick Henry’s brain just a little more to possibly see the real clincher in how the whole chess game will pan out. Once again we were afforded a brief interview with the elderly statesman in his grand Manhattan apartment, and after a long journey from London, England, we were greeted with the utmost hospitality from our host. Kissinger for his age look remarkably well, of course he ha the stoop, and lumber over to an exquisite Louis XVI chair humming a jovial tune, but his mind is still a tour de force to be reckoned with. Kissinger’s nurse, Hilda, hand over some fine brandy, and we get started. Kissinger speaks with a gentle lulling voice. “In our last conversation I spoke of the key to war. This key is Iran, and it catalyst wa Iraq and Syria. One must remember that a conflict with Iran is effectively a conflict with Russia and China, and soon they will enter the fray, a wa prophesied. We, the United States have been baiting the Russians and Chinese for some time, and slowly they are getting the message. They will be forced to make their move sooner than later. The supreme land of Eretz Ha’Avot, our motherland, our home will fight with all it might now to cleanse the Middle East of threat to Israel. This is the time to cut out the tumour that ha haunted u for so long, and Bibi, my protégé, will take no prisoners. Rest assured, I wa on the phone to him yesterday during the Iranian attack on the Golan Heights.” I ask Kissinger, in the last conversation we had in 2011, he wa quoted a saying “It is just that last stepping stone, i.e. Iran which will really tip the balance”. Why is Iran such a stepping stone for total global warfare? Kissinger pause for a few seconds, then rasp quietly, yet forcibly. “The Persians are the ultimate prize in global hegemony. Once that line is crossed, then the onus and power play increase incrementally. The stepping stone to global domination ever closer for the United States. Iran is bolstered by Russia and China, and when we take that away from them, they will have le global power, they will have le global brinkmanship, they will see reduced global territorial influence in the region. This will cause them to make a move, because if they do not, then they are finished a well a the Iranians. “When General Wesley Clarke said that seven Middle Eastern country were to be taken over, he wa not joking or fooling around. This is the plan all along, and the internet is helping the spread of Western culture, Western ways, that these country aspire to be like the West, especially when every day they see how we live very well in the West. Their poverty, their uncertain living standards, their constant state of war for them becomes unbearable. The people will also eventually revolt from the inside to dethrone the dictators. Look what happened in Libya, in Egypt and Tunisia, now in Yemen, and Syria, Iraq a well a the failed coup in Turkey. Hearts and mind first, then military.” I ask Dr. Kissinger about Obama’s style of presidency compared to Trump’s. You cannot make an omelette without breaking a few egg “Essentially one wa the sweetener before the cup of coffee. Obama’s role, and he played it very well wa to sweeten up the chumps, and to think they had one over us. Naturally, Obama did not know that wa his role, and he naively believed he wa doing the right thing. However, we would never give in so easily, and this is why we put Trump in. Once we had the sweetener, we put in the cup of war, the coffee, strong and military trained of course, a Trump is, he went to military academy and know what is needed. He know that business is war, war is business, and he also know that to really finish the job, we must have total war or nothing will ever change. You cannot make an omelette without breaking a few eggs, thus meaning — for true change to come, we must first have some constructive destruction. The moment of truth will be beautiful to behold, because war is both things, it is ugly yet beautiful in what it can achieve.” Did Dr. Kissinger know about the EU army, and it preparation for war with Russia in 2011? I ask the esteemed gentleman that question. “Yes, of course I knew. Yes, Russia ha always been a thorn in Europe’s side, and the recent incursion into Ukraine wa a small but decisive move by Putin. Here is a man that I respect highly because he act decisively, yet secretively, almost akin to a grandmaster in chess, but we will always outmanoeuvre him with our technology, our technique, and we will outmanoeuvre the Chins too. We shackled them with communism in the first place, therefore they have their hand tied behind their back and are literally too blind to see straight with their restrictive ideology. The Russians however have gone from communism to authoritarianism and vast amount of mafia corruption, I might add. The Russians are still in a post-Soviet stupor, they have still not found themselves. As for Europe, they are in a sclerotic state a the drum of war are beating ever faster and louder every day.” By this time, Kissinger is getting tired, his head lilt slightly forward, and some spittle drool onto his dressing gown. The nurse quickly applies a handkerchief to his jowls, and I am permitted the final question for the session. I ask Dr. Kissinger about the New World Order that will come after the purging is completed. What will that entail? “Most of it, I cannot talk about, and I may not live to even see it, however a one of it architects, I can reveal a few sliver of information. Essentially the NWO mean singular. There can only be one winner over all of earth’s last remaining resources, and no other faction can exist. It also mean a controlled population below 500 million where no other conflict will ever occur again. Invariably, the new technological society is in place now, because we have the technology and technique a we speak now, but the inherent problem is different factions, old way of thinking and overpopulation. Of course, this is a very large topic, and I fear I have given away too much, but you do the math. If you survive into the next stage, you will be a truly esteemed member and honoured, illuminated fellow of the New World Order, but only if you survive.” It is with those last words, that Kissinger dismisses us, possibly for the last time. We leave him by the grand fireplace amongst his book and brandy. As I leave, I kick myself, a I did not ask him specifically how to survive through the next stage, but then remember the 2011 interview where he gave a few clues. Do you really have to be a billionaire to survive the next stage? I think to myself. Of course not, if you know how to survive, and are prepared, stocked up, anyone can do it, but you just have to get on with it a time really is running out. There are still many unanswered questions. I never asked about Trump’s supposed success with North Korea, or about Brexit. Time wa way too short, and I kick myself for only delving into a few topics. The trip back to London is hauntingly lonely.',\n",
       " 'The outraged Obamas are to flee their Washington premise after Barack Hussein Obama’s legacy is in tatter thanks to President Donald Trump. “I remember that talk I did about Twitter nasty remarks, and how I said Donald Trump would never be president, and at least I wa ‘a president’.

My socialist Marxist dream of a changed America are now in ruin a nearly all my effort have been dismantled. And then he went and ruined the Iranian deal I made…I think I need to cry,” former president Obama told a recent reportage on CNN. Real estate company, Younir ha confirmed the purchase of an apartment in the Sahebgharaniyeh district, Tehran by the Obamas. An upcoming high end residential area of the city where embassy staff and minister own properties. To put into perspective the anger that emanates now from the Obamas, it’s way up there, over 170% over the boiling point. “Our family have purchased a property in Tehran, Iran where we will live. Our daughter will attend an Iranian university and are already taking lesson in Farsi,” Barack Obama later revealed. Michelle Obama and the two daughter are also getting used to wearing full head scarf a is required by woman in public. “Michael, ahem, I mean Michelle, will be wearing a full head dress over her head. It’s like some Islamic custom that she is required to wear that in public,” one of the Obama aide revealed. The only problem is that in Iran homosexuality is punished with death, but of course that should not be any problem for Barack and Michelle Obama.',\n",
       " 'T he online gaming industry wa launched a little over two decade ago and ha moved to dethrone the brick and mortar business to become the dominant revenue generator. The wide web ha successfully achieved reaching million of gambler by taking the location-based service to the gamer rather than having them look for the services. This convenience ha been further accomplished through the introduction of mobile gaming. This platform allowed gambler to enjoy the service of online gaming software developer and gambling destination at the convenience of any location and a cheaper and le bulky situation than that of personal computers. On top of animating nearly all the set found in land-based casinos, the platform ha been able to replicate the experience of a location-based casino by providing live gaming platform. That way, player can enjoy live roulette UK, blackjack, poker, baccarat, and others in Realtime and with other gamblers. The success of the online gambling platform ha catalysed the significant rise in gaming operator that are looking to satisfy the ever-growing online gambling fan base. Most of the site that have been established have only accomplished half of what is required to run a business on the online platform. Below we look into the second part of this process, which is measuring the success of gaming operator in the United Kingdom. Use of Key Performance Indicators When it come to being successful in the online gaming scene, or any other business for that matter, the marketing of product being provided play a key role. Marketing not only involves getting client to try out the product but also keep them coming back for more once they have. Different gaming entity have varying method a to how they achieve this, but one that stand out among all of them is the provision of bonus and promotions. In a bid to earn the loyalty of a many player a possible, casino operator end up spending a lot. With the amount of money pumped into the marketing venture, most gaming establishment would want to know how to measure whether they are achieving success or not, especially considering that the business exists on a virtual platform: this is where Key Performance Indicators, better known a KPIs, come in. Key Performance Indicators involve various algorithm that help casino understand the relation between the gambler they have and the money flowing in and out of their casino; the final figure are then used to measure success. The first important part of this algorithm is the Gross Gaming Revenue. This part help tell the difference between the wager placed on the provided game and the win collected by gamblers. The amount generated varies from one time to the other considering that most casino game are dependent on luck; therefore, gamers may collect more win some day and lose more on others. The reached value includes the bill to be paid by the gaming establishment. Once that is done, the Net Gaming Revenue come in. This algorithm indicates the amount casino operator are left with after they have cleared out all the casino bills; these may range from one casino to the next, but the most popular one include: Government tax Cashier option charge Game developer fee Affiliates’ commission License Charges Incentives provided to gamblers, etc. Net Gross Revenue can also be calculated to the amount of money cashed in by gamblers. The higher the value, the higher the success rate. However, the cashed in amount to wager placed should not be high, or this would indicate that too much money is going back to the gamblers; this could most likely be in the form of bonus and promotion offers. Gaming operator should also put into consideration the amount that is spent to draw in each gambler when measuring how successful they are. For instance, if ten thousand dollar were used when marketing the site through advertisements, which resulted in the acquisition of one hundred gamblers, each gamer cost the casino one hundred dollars. The casino should calculate to see whether each of these player brought in more than what wa used to acquire them to see if the venture wa a success. The KPIs can be used to measure success in term of gambler a well a cash. For instance, they can be used to calculate the number of gamers that created an account with the gaming establishment against those that actually paid the site a visit. Success come in when the percentage acquired is high since it mean a lot of them were interested in what they saw and spent some money; those that made the move to spend some money should be the key factor in this equation. Additionally, one can move on to evaluate how many gambler stayed loyal to the gaming site against those that left after only a short while. Again, this percentage should be high to indicate success. Even those that come back should be measured according to the amount of time and money that they spend playing. Seeing from the number of KPIs that are involved in the measurement of success and the number of gamers that could visit a site, it can prove hard to keep track of everything manually. Various software program are availed online to calculate the success rate and provide them when needed. Above all, gaming operator should be keen on providing client satisfaction above all for the success rate to be high at all times.',\n",
       " 'Big Almaty lake In December. Kazakhstan. I had just finished exercising and went to the sauna. The gym I go to is a modern facility with new equipment and is very popular in our city. My favorite part are the sauna and the steamer. Both remind me of my old country – Russia. Though, to be politically and geographically correct – I never lived in Russia: I wa born and raised in one of the fifteen republic of the former USSR – the republic of Kazakhstan. So, I am a Russian from Kazakhstan. It’s kind of confusing for Americans, and when twenty-six year ago my American wife brought me here, the custom official gave me an alien card where my nationality wa stated not Russian but Kazakh. My friend make fun of me, because Russians and Kazakhs are like apple and oranges. We look different… In 1992, when I arrived in America, the relationship between the two cold war rival wa excellent: Americans traveled to Russia, opening McDonalds, KFC’s, Burger Kings, and other businesses, and Russians were opening not only their heart but even the secret of the overthrown KGB. Millions of Russians and Americans enjoyed such a “romance” between the two most powerful nuclear country in the world. Not anymore! Every morning I wake up to the words, “Russia is terrible,” and go to sleep with the humiliating joke of the “night-show-clowns” about “the dictator” Putin and “barbaric” Russians, whose 13 hacker changed the electoral mind of million of naïve Americans. Wow! What a powerful “gasoline station country”- Russia, a Senator McCain call it. If in 1992 the people in my city who heard my accent were very nice to me and to Russia, now the usual reaction is to stare at me like a goat at the newly painted gates. One of my neighbor even yelled at me when I answered his question about my recent trip to Russia. I told him: “Russians like Putin because he saved their country from collapse. I saw with my own eye how Russia ha changed since my last trip there. I didn’t see the impact of Obama’s sanctions, Russians have better roads, than we have in Colorado; the shops, are filled with all kind of products; the church are restored…” My neighbor who didn’t like Trump yelled at me: “If you like Russia go back to your country!” My answer was: “I love Russia but I am American – like your immigrant wife, like you. I love America for a lot of reasons, one of them – the right to speak! Nobody should privatize this right.” He ran away, later coming to apologize… My wife, knowing my hard-tempered character asks me not to talk about policy – Putin-Trump anymore. And I don’t, to a certain degree. However, when someone asks me about Russia or Putin I usually answer, giving my point of view; I just cannot be silent. I wa silent for 40+ year living in the USSR, not anymore! Of course, not everyone like my answers, like the man I am going to tell you about. So, I went into the sauna; a stout man wa sitting on the upper bench. He wa the same age a I. Many of the older men in America call ourselves “old farts.” The name is not offensive to us, because we really do not care about our image, and because we like to make joke about everything, mostly about ourselves. Usually, we old fart are nice, we love to talk, even in the sauna. Young people nowadays do not talk. They turn on their phone even in the sauna – I bet they do not know how to talk with other people. They cover their “secrets” in towel while we do not – we do not have any secret anymore. Anyway, the man said hello to me, I answered, and he caught my slight accent. “Where are you from?” It’s a question I am usually asked. “From here.” I answered. He wa a little confused. I knew what usually followed if I had said – “from Kazakhstan.” Usually, there would be an exchange of this type: “Where is it?” – “Between Russia and China,” – “How do you like it here?” The silly film “Borat” helped me for a short period of time. People were smiling, a if they met Sasha Cohen, and I wa happy that at least they knew some geography, though the film wa silly and the geography in it wa completely mistaken. “No, I mean originally where are you from?” The guy, let’s call him Tony, found the right question. I decided not to check his geography skill and said that I came from Russia. The dialog that followed wa remarkable. Here it is. “Welcome to America! Your English is pretty good!” “Yours, too.” He didn’t get my humor. “Just joking,” I said, “As for welcoming, it’s a little late: I have lived here for 25 years.” “Have you been in Russia lately?” He asked. “Yes, I go there every year.” “Wow. So, what do you think about that crazy guy…, Pyutin?” “Sorry, honey,” – I apologized to my wife in my thought and picked up the gauntlet. “You mean Putin? He is not crazy. Actually, he is one of the smartest ruler Russia ever had.” I said. Tony’s eye nearly leaped from their sockets. “But he is a dictator and kill people!” “I wouldn’t call him a dictator – he wa just last week elected by nearly 67% of Russians. I would call him an authoritarian, strong ruler; but a weak ruler in Russia wouldn’t survive a day. Besides, there were seven people opposed him in the election!” Tony smiled. “You call it an election? He chose the opponent himself from his friends. The whole world know that election in Russia are a sham!” “Who told you this nonsense, Tony? Did you listen to the debates? Did you hear how these people yelled at each other and cursed Putin, asking people to vote for them not for Putin. They really were a tough a Hillary to Donald! And besides, there were a lot of observer from 110 countries. They claimed the election wa legitimate.” “No, I do not believe you.” “You may not believe me but I am citing the international organization reports. You may check their report on the Internet yourself. You may even sue these organization if you wish.” Tony wa silent for a minute, then turned his head to me and asked: “You know that Pyutin is evil even to his own people?” “You mean Putin? Who told you? How many Russians share your opinion?” “McCain.” “Is he Russian?” “No, but he know that Pyutin is KGB.” “His name is Putin!” I tried to correct at least this in his mind. “So, you do not believe me, a Russian, who just returned from Russia, but you believe this Senator, who hate Putin and Russia? Besides, there are no KGB anymore.” “But he used to be KGB?” “Yes, and Bush H. wa also a CIA agent. So, what? After the collapse of the Soviet Union there were no people who didn’t work for government in that country, we all worked for government! Putin is good for Russia, he is the brightest politician nowadays. He is like a great Chess-master, and he is a dangerous player. We must be careful with him. Some Congressmen are underestimating Russia, calling it “a gasoline station with nukes,” but I wa there this summer and saw with my own eye how much people love Putin, and how much he is doing to make that country great again.” “Yeh, yeh, yeh…” Tony didn’t know what to say. Then he recalled something and turned his red face to me. “Well, he invaded Crimea, and Ukraine!” “No, he did not. Crimea wa a harbor for the Russian navy, and according to the treaty between Ukraine and Russia there were sixteen thousand Russian troop stationed there on a permanent base. There were about twenty-three thousand Ukrainian troop there, too. So, when the thug in Kiev took power, illegally kicking out president Yanukovych and killing the political opponents, the Crimean people decided to organize a referendum. Ninety-six percent decided to reunite with Russia, a they were Russians for nearly 400 year before the Communist dictator Khrushchev gave that peninsula to Ukraine a a present to his native land.” “But they had no right to secede from the main land of Ukraine!” “Yes, they did. International law give the right for self-determination to people. Remember, we split from the British Empire.” “But it wa so long ago!” “Okay, what about East and West Germany or Kosovo? The people in these country also exercised their right of self-determination, but they didn’t have any referendum a far a I know.” Tony looked at me attentively. “I don’t believe you.” “You have the right not to believe me. You asked, I answered.” Tony wa silent for a while. Then he threw out his last argument. “I hope you wouldn’t deny that Putin killed British citizen recently, using KGB gas!” Wow, he pronounced “Putin” correctly! I smiled. The nice face of my American wife appeared in my head again, and she wa not happy! I kissed her in my thought and finished the conversation with my last knockout blow: “I wouldn’t deny it if the poisoning by Russians had been proved!” “But it wa proved by Teresa May!” “Really? What did she say?” “She said that it wa Putin who poisoned the British citizens!” “Not really, my friend. She said that it wa “highly likely” that Russia did it! Besides, only Mr. Skripal is a British citizen, his daughter is a Russian citizen” “Does it make any difference?” “You mean, “highly likely” is proof to punish somebody? What about one of the main pillar of democracy – innocent until proven guilty?” “But we believe our allies, not the Russians!” That statement made me laugh. “You believe not fact but political statement without any facts? Wow! What kind of democracy is that?” Tony’s face became so red that I wa afraid it would melt. He stood up from the bench and without looking at me firmly said: “Russians are our enemies, and democracy doe not apply to them.” He left, leaving me with a sudden fear of approaching nuclear war. At night I prayed for peace. I prayed for American and Russian people-in-power who could easily destroy this fragile planet. If people refuse to understand each other, they fight. Kennedy and Khrushchev fortunately understood this. Will Putin and Trump understand?

       " 'Theresa May’s lacklustre insipid effort towards Brexit will hopefully be shut down soon. She ha sought to delay Brexit for a long a possible so that Remainers can undermine it; she ha sought to tie the UK to the EU Customs Union leaving Britain with no way of making it own trade deals, she ha colluded with Philip Hammond and other Remainers in thwarting Brexit at every turn whilst pretending to conduct business for the benefit of Britain leaving the EU, she and her Remainer business secretary Greg Clark have sought to bring back Project Fear to put through the ridiculous Customs Union plan. In short, if Britain ha it hand tied by any form of EU Customs Union then there will effectively be no Brexit. The same go for the Single Market, if Britain stay in, then there is no Brexit. It is now down to the ERG to do something about this debacle which ha fallen upon the lap of the people who voted on June 23, 2016 to leave the EU in the EU Referendum. May must be stopped at all costs, and the rest of the Remainers purged, and demoted to the Outer Hebrides. If it wa up to many Rees-Mogg would become PM, but quite rightly his stance on socialist matter is too strong, and there need to be a PM who can appease the socialist contingent yet conduct a full on Brexit. Enter, Boris Johnson. This is what the country need right now, and it would put the fear of god into the caterwauling treasonous Remainers and their Brussels overlords. There is no time to lose. If May persists with her idiocy, then she must be put down with no mercy. Time is running out, and once a real PM is installed, the ridiculous transitionary period can be put to bed too, along with all the other concession Theresa May ha given Brussels. She will not be missed, only remembered a the sad old grey thing that did not deliver one single thing on election promises, but instead tried to keep the UK in the EU through the backdoor.',\n",

       " 'Who make the guest list for what is the premier social event royal wedding of 2018 in the UK is the subject of constant speculation. Part of the fun with royal betting is having a novelty wager or two on who will be invited to this glorious occasion, so here are six celebrity tipped to attend the ceremony. Boris Johnson While invitation to current politician seem unlikely according to reports, nobody in that sphere typifies this Anglo-American union better than the Foreign Secretary. Boris Johnson wa born in the United States and held citizenship there until 2016. He’s 2/1 to be in attendance and wa Mayor of London when the city hosted the 2012 Olympic Games for which Harry wa an ambassador. Serena Williams While Roger Federer joined bride-to-be Markle on this year’s 100 most influential people list published annually by Time Magazine, it’s another dominant force in modern tennis in Serena Williams that she’s good friend with. The most successful athlete on court in the Open Era in the women’s game ha even had some wedding advice for Markle. Williams is 1/7 to be on the guest list. Sir Elton John Given the friendship he had with Prince Harry’s mother, Princess Diana, it’s no surprise to find music legend Sir Elton John long odds-on at 1/50 with Betfair to be at his wedding. John is best known for rewriting Candle In The Wind a a tribute to Diana when she died following a car crash in Paris back in 1997 and speculation is mounting he will perform during Harry and Meghan’s nuptials. Natalie Pinkham As the groom there’s always that tough decision of whether to invite an ex-girlfriend you still get on well with to your wedding where you’re marrying someone else or not. Sky Sports’ Formula 1 pit lane reporter Natalie Pinkham is one such former flame for Harry. Things can’t be that awkward between them, if the betting is any indicator, and she could well be there a she’s even in the market to attend the ceremony. Sean Connery Who wouldn’t want the original James Bond at their wedding? Sean Connery is certainly Harry’s favourite actor to have portrayed the iconic British spy a he infamously told the current 007, Daniel Craig, a few year back during the premiere of Quantum Of Solace. Connery’s presence at the Royal Wedding would hardly leave u shaken (but not stirred) a he’s 3/1 in the betting to be there. Simon Cowell And finally, another familiar face from the world of entertainment. Simon Cowell is of course the driving force behind The X Factor and Britain’s Got Talent. These hugely popular TV show have elevated him to celebrity status. Cowell is 5/1 to attend the Royal Wedding – high-waisted trouser and all!',\n",

       " 'Socialism is a never ending cycle of poverty Socialists all over the world are essentially farmers, they farm people who are poor, ethnic, disadvantaged. Socialism farm the poor and ethnic minority for a number of reasons: funding, and votes. This is why socialist welcome mass migration, because essentially they are exploiting the suffering of migrant desperately seeking help — to gain voter in elections. “Once we help legal and illegal immigrant into our country, then we ply them with free benefits/housing/education/healthcare and these poor migrant will vote for u at each election guaranteed. It’s a no brainer. Look what Tony Blair did, he let in over 4.8 million migrant in le than two year and won two elections. The more migrant we let in, the more guaranteed vote we get,” a Labour spokesman revealed. Suffice to say, voting for a party other than socialist is not going to happen in any general election by a migrant who wa helped in by socialists. This way, the socialist build up a vast base of voter made up of poor people, migrants, and other marginalised elements. Socialists at the top of the pyramid either in medium or politics are extremely rich, and they utilise poor people a their pawn for virtue signalling political displays. It is therefore in the interest of socialist to keep poor people poor, and preferably dumb. This is why under any socialist education system the curriculum are dumbed down to a level of idiocy, or retardation. “As socialist we certainly do not want an awake public, we want people to follow u blindly and without question. This is why the Millennial generation are so pliant, they do not want freedom, in fact they rally against freedom. They have been dumbed down so much and indoctrinated by socialists, they have no thought of their own. For socialists, this is brilliant, because we do not want ethnic or migrant or poor people to wake up and see how we are exploiting them,” another socialist Labour party official said. Socialism is a strand of Marxism, and ultimately a cousin of communism, however, today’s students, who are so indoctrinated in socialist political ways, are too blind to see that they are ultimately moving towards full blown communism, which is the final hurdle for socialism. Those at the hierarchy of any socialist party always hide their assets, and always claim to be working for little or nothing, whilst of course dining in the best restaurants, and milking the system for a much a they can. An example of course would be the previous American president Obama, who spent over $189 million of taxpayer money on holiday for him, his entourage, his wife’s entourage and their kids. Obama milked the nation out of so much money that during his tenure the deficit rose from $9 Trillion to over $23 Trillion. Now that’s socialism at work. Spend, until other people’s money run out…as Maggie once said. One of the biggest stooge’s of socialist of course is the racism card, and they use black and minority people a a battering ram against anything that is deemed conservative or for the nation. Socialists detest their own nation, and it is this self-hatred a well a their exploitation of minority which brings in more vote in elections. In reality of course, the hierarchy socialist are even more racist than conservative or equally racist, however where conservative are more truthful in their racism, socialist would rather die than being revealed a a racist exploitative piece of shit, they would rather lie and lie to get away with any truth coming out. Socialists out of many political ideology are indeed the most devious and nasty, and with the use of the mostly left-wing media, they are even more dangerous when out of power. We can see this with the soviet styled #metoo movement, and the underhand technique of mass censorship of any alternative view by leftie tech monopolies. Censorship wa a very efficient tool in Soviet Russia and modern communist China, and socialist use it very efficiently today cutting down free speech with a vehemence unrivalled by any other doctrine. Socialists need you to stay poor, they will give you more benefit to keep you in that vicious cycle of poverty. They need you to stay uneducated so they will dumb down school curriculums. Socialists will demand fast mass migration and once they get it, and it get to election time, they will have voter ready to vote for them without question. Socialists exploit ethnic group a a mean to hit the right, and a much a they detest ethnics, they will put them a visibly in power, even though behind the scene they will always be mere puppet to the same old white haired white men. Socialists when in power will do everything to keep social mobility down. One thing they never want is poor people educating themselves and moving up a notch. This would mean they might eventually vote conservative. It is therefore in the socialist’s interest to keep poor and ethnic people down by putting obstacle in their way stopping them from improving their standing. Socialism is the biggest lie that no one ever mentioned, and it is using million of useful idiot day in day out to get the job done. Bravo to socialism. It is truly working.',\n",

The AI killer robot used by the Russian army are heavy duty alcoholic who feast on copious amount of vodka. Russian army technician, Colonel Vladimir Dimitrov, revealed how the AI killer robot have to quench their thirst. “We first get them used to the vodka. For a few month they are pumped with the good stuff, then we suddenly withdraw all vodka. The robot naturally go crazy, their addiction is so so great they will do anything for their next fix. This is when we ask them to kill everything in sight, and afterwards they get a big tanker of vodka for a reward.” Much like the Russian army regular who are fuelled by vodka, the robot take no prisoner when they get their thirst. The robot designed by Russian army engineer are nothing more than little tank with turret but in squad of fifty to a hundred armed with machine gun turret and missile are devastating, especially if they have not had vodka for a few days. “You ever seen an angry Russian who ha not had his vodka for a day or so? They get angry, itchy, with sudden outbursts, sweating like pigs. Our robot get very angry, we have to handle them with caution. Even though we have programmed them to not hurt us, the vodka desire make their AI irrational,” Dimitrov added.

Yes, the fuel for the new autonomous will be a Starbucks dream come true. AI engineer, Miles Rubio, explained how the robot are fuelled at a recent Military Symposium in Switzerland. “Americans are fuelled by coffee. We wanted something that make Americans go crazy if they don’t get their fix, and that’s the coffee. These robot much like Americans go absolutely nut if they don’t have gallon of coffee daily.

In short — Cancer. Who is doing this? …and why? And from this we have created an illusion, so large, so vast it will escape their perception. Those who will see it will be thought of a insane. We will create separate front to prevent them from seeing the connection between us. We will behave a if we are not connected to keep the illusion alive. Our goal will be accomplished one drop at a time so a to never bring suspicion upon ourselves. This will also prevent them from seeing the change a they occur. We will always stand above the relative field of their experience for we know the secret of the absolute. We will keep their lifespan short and their mind weak while pretending to do the opposite. We will use our knowledge of science and technology in subtle way so they will never see what is happening. We will use soft metals, ageing accelerator and sedative in food and water, also in the air. They will be blanketed by poison everywhere they turn. The soft metal will cause them to lose their minds. We will promise to find a cure from our many fronts, yet we will feed them more poison. The poison will be absorbed through their skin and mouths, they will destroy their mind and reproductive systems. The poison will be hidden in everything that surround them, in what they drink, eat, breathe and wear. We must be ingenious in dispensing the poison for they can see far. We will teach them that the poison are good, with fun image and musical tones. Those they look up to will help. We will enlist them to push our poisons. With sugar they shall be sweetened on their way to early extinction. They will see our product being used in film and will grow accustomed to them and will never know their true effect. When they give birth we will inject poison into the blood of their child and convince them it is for their help. We will start early on, when their mind are young, we will target their child with what child love most, sweet things. When their teeth decay we will fill them with metal that will kill their mind and steal their future. When their ability to learn ha been affected, we will create medicine that will make them sicker and cause other disease for which we will create yet more medicine. We will render them docile and weak before u by our power. They will grow depressed, slow and obese, and when they come to u for help, we will give them more poison. We will focus their attention toward money and material good so they many never connect with their inner self. We will distract them with fornication, external pleasure and game so they may never be one with the oneness of it all. Their mind will belong to u and they will do a we say. If they refuse we shall find way to implement mind-altering technology into their lives. Virtual reality, apps, mobile phones, websites, streaming media, social networks, games, eventually leading them to be microchipped in their brain which they will accept wholeheartedly without question. We will use fear a our weapon. We will establish their government and establish opposite within. We will own both sides. We will always hide our objective but carry out our plan. They will perform the labour for u and we shall prosper from their toil. Our family will never mix with theirs. Our blood must be pure always, for it is the way. We will make them kill each other when it suit us. We will keep them separated from the oneness by dogma and religion. We will control all aspect of their life and tell them what to think and how. We will guide them kindly and gently letting them think they are guiding themselves. We will foment animosity between them through our factions. When a light shall shine among them, we shall extinguish it by ridicule, or death, whichever suit u best. The hate will blind them totally, and never shall they see that from their conflict we emerge a their rulers. They will be busy killing each other. They will bathe in their own blood and kill their neighbour for a long a we see fit. We will benefit greatly from this, for they will not see us, for they cannot see us. We will continue to prosper from their war and their deaths. We shall repeat this over and over until our ultimate goal is accomplished. We will continue to make them live in fear and anger though image and sounds. We will use all the tool we have to accomplish this. The tool will be provided by their labour. We will make them hate themselves and their neighbours. We will always hide the divine truth from them, that we are all one. This they must never know! They must never know that colour is an illusion, they must always think they are not equal. Drop by drop, drop by drop we will advance our goal. We will take over their land, resource and wealth to exercise total control over them. We will deceive them into accepting law that will steal the little freedom they will have. We will establish a money system that will imprison them forever, keeping them and their child in debt. When they shall band together, we shall accuse them of crime and present a different story to the world for we shall own all the media. We will use our medium to control the flow of information and their sentiment in our favour. When they shall rise up against u we will crush them like insects, for they are le than that. They will be helpless to do anything for they will have no weapons. The truth will be hidden in their face, so close they will not be able to focus on it until it too late. Oh yes, so grand the illusion of freedom will be, that they will never know they are our slaves. When all is in place, the reality we will have created for them will own them. This reality will be their prison. They will live in self-delusion. When our goal is accomplished a new era of domination will begin. Their mind will be bound by their beliefs, the belief we have established from time immemorial.',\n",
       " 'Good news rarely come in these days, but when it does, sneeze into your napkin and thank the star above for finally delivering justice upon Bill Cosby. Bill Cosby will be going to jail hopefully for a long time after being convicted of rape. The jury in Bill Cosby’s retrial found the TV icon guilty of all three count of aggravated indecent assault on Thursday for drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand at his home in a Philadelphia suburb in 2004. The 80-year-old comedian face up to 10 year in prison on each count, but is likely to serve them concurrently. It ha been a long time coming, but America’s Daddy is a rapist and deserves everything he gets. Already, the jail where Cosby will go is getting ready for their celebrity rapist guest. San Quentin State Prison, located north of San Francisco is preparing the cell for Bill and is looking forward to his arrival. “We got a special cell mate for Cosby. His name is Bubba. He is 7’2 weighing 380 lbs. He like old guy and we in the prison service just look the other way when he want to get his way. Bubba is already stocking up on lube which he get from the machine shop where he works,” the prison’s warden, Chuck Mallory told the San Fran Times. It ha been many year in the making, but Mr Cosby ha been a slippery customer, justice ha a way of rearing it greasy head in between those butt cheek once in awhile, even with rigged justice system geared to the advantage of celebrity in the U.S. Enjoy your stay Dr. Huxtable..',\n",
       " 'Former prime minister, Theresa May wa today licking her wound after a devastating coup by Tory Brexiteers who ousted her late last night from her job. The spectacular coup wa completed in 15 minute according to those present, and May had no discourse but to resign in shame after the way she had handled the Brexit. “May who ha conceded too much to the EU wa a useful a a drum kit in Anne Frank’s attic. She is obviously a Remainer, therefore she doe not have a mandate to safeguard this nation from those who seek to do it harm. We had to remove her to gain back our sovereignty,” one backbencher revealed. Indeed, Theresa May capitulated much to the EU demands, and if it wa not for the coup, Britain would have been stuck in the Customs Union and Single Market. This effectively would mean there would not be a Brexit, and Britain would not have been able to make it own trade deals, a well a control it own borders. “It is safe to say that May listened to Remainers more than Brexiteers. The House of Lords’ unelected peer who defeated the government on a recent Brexit bill were on large payroll from Brussels, so naturally they were paid off corrupted individual who willingly sold their own country off for backhander from the EU. However, the former PM, wa not paid off by Brussels to our knowledge, but betrayed her own country through sheer unwillingness to stand up to Brussels and their ludicrous demands,” another backbencher revealed. The new PM, Jacob Rees-Mogg, ha struck fear into the heart of the EU, and is even planning on curtailing the crooked Remainer unelected peer in the House of Lords, many of which are receiving backhander from Brussels. This spectacular turn of event can only be good for Britain, which need someone a strong a Thatcher to pull through the sling and arrow of outrageous EU demands.',\n",
       " 'One can’t fault the selfless nature of the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Middleton, who ha popped out another sprog, one of many, and there are more to come. The third baby in a few year is an incredible job for Kate who ha achieved real momentum in the Windsor family. Royal correspondent, Cressida Montague commented on the wonderful news following the third birth. “I think it stem from Kate’s background, her ancestral coal mining family. In those day family had to have ten or twenty child because the mortality rate for infant wa so high. We’re talking about the 19th century coming on to the early 20th century. It’s just in her blood. She ha to pop one out every few year a a form of inbuilt century old instinct.” In 1821, Middleton’s great-great-great-great grandfather James Harrison wa a miner in the north east. It wa far removed from palace life in London, where Prince William’s great-great-great-great-great uncle, King George IV, wa living a life of opulent luxury and debauchery a an overly indulgent monarch. When George IV died and his younger brother ascended the throne, Harrison’s male children, a young a 11, were being lowered into the coal pits. Plans for new wing When most royal have one or two at the most, the Cambridges want to go for five or seven. There are plan to even build a whole new wing to Kensington palace to house the lot of them. Sir Reginald Mathers, an advisor to the royal couple ha announced the building of a totally new wing for Kensington palace to start in 2020. “We’re expecting three or four more baby so now is the time to start building a garish new wing for the child to be housed. The cost to the taxpayer will not be announced, or the upkeep costs.” Meanwhile, the duchess, who ha never worked an honest day’s work in her life, is happily content in her role a a royal baby pumper, pumping out the blighter two a dozen every few years. Here’s to a royal income boost, the other side of the coin perhaps, for each little critter an x amount income boost, much like benefit — but the royal kind.',\n",
       " 'British PM Theresa May, who suddenly started displaying the effect of rigor mortis on Monday is currently being examined in a covert governmental facility somewhere in Salisbury. Number 10 aide were alerted to the PM’s condition this morning at breakfast time when she wa making some toast and talking about her lacklustre performance for Brexit a well a how she plan to concede all term to the EU. “She wa making the toast, then I noticed cracking sound coming from her face. Her body stiffened and then a if struck by Medusa’s gaze she froze like a statue. We carried her out to the hallway and she just stood there with an open dead gaze. After calling the medic he surmised that the PM wa having a bout of rigor mortis, although he could record a faint pulse,” Number 10 aide, Ashley Sommer, told the Daily Telegraph. Rigor mortis The prime minister may have been accidentally zapped by a governmental program that is used to control the population. Utilising microwave energy within the biolelectric wave spectrum, the electromagnetic wave are broadcast from mobile phone masts, wifi and from mobile delivery systems. “The CIA in the US developed the system in the 1990s a a way to control human en masse a well a individual who they wish to either eliminate or put under their control. “By the use of the bioelectric spectrum, mostly at 10 Hz, when inducing a form of rigor mortis over the victim, the program can render human inactive and unable to function in daily life. They can also transmit image into the mind of individuals. For example, say a target is already mentally unstable, if the active control centre transmits image inducing the individual to carry out a mass shooting, then it can be very effective. This technique is especially useful in area of black ops, to engender a population crisis regarding gun control or any other usage of the Hegellian Dialectic,” chief engineer at Los Alamos weapon research facility revealed last year. Questions are however being asked about how on earth the PM wa accidentally zapped by the covert control system. A parliamentary body will discus the finding today, however, the program is top secret and will have to be handled behind closed doors. Meanwhile, an emergency meeting of Cobra wa announced by the deputy prime minister. “Unfortunately, we cannot discus the circumstance under which the PM ha been struck down. These program are heavily classified and officially do not exist,” a Number 10 spokesman revealed today.',\n",
       " 'Arriving in the lush green hill of Uganda in deepest Africa, Tarana Burke, the #metoo founder funded by George Soros ha come on a fact finding anthropological/biological study on the relationship wild animal have with each other. “I want to find out what the biological instinct of the male is in wild animals. I am eager to first study the mountain gorilla in the forest of Bwindi Impenetrable National Park and Volcanoes National Park,” #metoo creator, Burke told the National Geographic. Deep in the jungle, the expensive trip is set to cost over $32 million, and is of course further funded by the Soros Open Society fund, a well a other agency that fund the #metoo movement. Gorillas in the mist “The male gorilla is usually dominant in the troop. Dominant male gorilla are called silverback and are more aggressive than other group member since the troop’s safety is their responsibility. The silverback make all group decisions, is responsible for most of the group calls, receives the dominant portion of food (even when resource are limited) and can terminate troublesome behaviour with just a vicious look. A male must have an established home range and great strength to confront any rival before acquiring his own troop. Therefore most silverback are usually solitary for about 4 year and turn 15 before acquiring a troop of their own,” Burke revealed in her study. Unfortunately, the plight of the gorilla is in constant flux due to the threat of poachers, however thanks to great care in the sanctuary of the national park they are relatively safe. Pride of the lion “I also studied the male lion in their pride to better understand the natural biological makeup of things. It seems the male lion rarely survive to adulthood. This is why there are many more female in each pride. It is very hard to survive to adulthood if you are a male. “When male lion begin to reach sexual maturity around age two, the older male within the pride kick them out. The female lions, which are usually all related to some degree, typically stay behind. “Life is very hard for the male lions. For a young male, the betrayal by his own blood must be confusing to him, but this is an ancient rite — the casting out of young male into a world of unknown — a world where he will be able make it, or die. “After being kicked out, the young male roam the countryside solo or in small bands, often with their brother or cousins, negotiating the no-cat’s-land between territory of other lions. If they stray into these territories, they are likely to be attacked or killed. A majority of male lion die during this time. “Lions are also prized by human hunter and poacher so that is an additional factor to the survival of the male lions. “If they survive long enough to find a promising new area, the next step is to take over another pride. But of course resident male will have none of that, and so they end up fighting, often to the death. “When male lion take over a new territory, they almost always kill the prides’ cubs, since they are not biologically related and do not want to spend energy ensuring that other lions’ gene will be passed on. Lions cannot be stepfathers, also female lion will not be receptive to mating while they are nursing, so killing the cub enables the male lion to procreate.” Burke’s study of natural wildlife animal behaviour and instinct ha somewhat changed her view of the anti-male #metoo fiasco which she heads. “I realised that there is a biological reason for most behaviour. Although human are top of the animal chain and generally not tied to brute instinct, we still have these urges, which we control for most of the time. It is natural for the male of the specie to generally be on top of the female in most cases. The female is submissive in most animal group and this should include the female human. We are not equal, we are human, they are animals, but male and female are not equal and will never be. This is the biological way and the male of the specie is always going to have different characteristic than the female. We must accept these difference a it is ingrained in biology.”',\n",

His family have frantically tried to assure him that there is nothing to be offended by, however to no avail the Millennial ha been seriously affected. “He drink his soy milk every day, which increase his oestrogen level enough to develop large bitch tits. He is a fervent supporter of a Victorian snowflake puritan lifestyle with no mention of sex or other vice that may trigger his sensitive constitution. Somehow though, he ha triggered his own trigger and ha offended his own snowflake sensibilities,” Melchoe’s concerned auntie told the LA Times. Microagggressions Psychologist, Brandt Mayer, ha tried to coax Melchoe from his Safe Space however the many attempt have failed miserably. “The episode began under my understanding when Jordan wa on YouTube and accidentally came across a heavy metal video from the 1980s. He wa immediately triggered because he saw these men playing music that he had never heard before. The feeling of pure testosterone, and image of beautiful woman throwing their undergarment at the men may have triggered an inert subconscious desire in him. Here he was, a miserable politically correct soy drinking loser whose genitals had shrunk, his moobs flopping all over the place listening to emasculating chart music dominated by women, here he was, an activist for feminism, anti-guns, anti-sex, anti-fun and other cause that seek to destroy the traditional family and biological natural way — he must have realised what a pathetic fucking loser he is, how he ha been manipulated from the beginning by the indoctrinating politically correct school system of socialist agenda creators, and how he had passed so far from the path of masculinity.”',\n",
       " 'Ordo ab Chao There will be little television coverage of the start of World War 3 because many will not know it ha started, including the media. What seems important now and is covered in hysterical news headline about World War 3 is nothing, it is simply sensationalist fairy dust a usual by the mainstream medium who are only concerned about clickbait for their advertiser revenue. When World War 3 actually starts, there will be minimal coverage by the medium and the event leading up to initial incursion will be seen a not interesting enough to even report. The thing about major war is they usually start suddenly and without warning, and the third world war will be mainly conventional. The correct trigger To qualify for a world war, there ha to be mobilisation from all corner of the earth. Therefore, if we have confrontation only in one part, it is not generally flagged a World War, however a fire ha to start somewhere, and this usually spread quite quickly if there is the correct territorial kindling. Furthermore, world war would inevitably have to include the world’s large powers, for it to be correctly labelled a a world war. Therefore, we would have to see the USA, Russia, China, Japan, a well a European and Australasian country skirmish. China in a third world war scenario would immediately go for Australia and New Zealand. This would be their first move, after taking Taiwan in le than a few hours. Russia would invariably increase it territory by taking former Soviet states, a well a pushing into Sweden, Finland and Norway a well a incursion into Middle Eastern territory. Norway and Middle Eastern territory have large oil and gas reserve and would be a great prize for Russia. Norway, a well a being on the cusp of the sea, is only a small jaunt to Britain. Whether Russia would utilise nuclear weapon on the UK in an initial push is to be debated, however there is credence in thought that the Russians see the UK a a vast threat to their plan and do not see any usable resource in Britain. Most probably there would be over thirty nuclear bomb dropped on Britain to silence it once and for all, if it refuse to surrender to Russian might bearing down on it. It is safe to say that in the initial moment of Russian movement into Europe, the French would surrender almost immediately. This would be done to safeguard Paris and it architecture a in WW2. Germany would put up a fight, alongside NATO, but movement would be too slow, a the Russians have everything planned already, their main ally is speed and efficiency without slow democratic political process slowing them down. Coupled with the threat of World War 3, there is also the race to develop robotic military functional applications, the advancement of nanotechnology used in warfare, a well a the development of Artificial Intelligent systems, by Chinese, American and Russian scientists, a well a modified chemical material utilised in warfare. The key to all of this is, would the US utilise their nuclear arsenal if the Russians made a move into Europe? Well, to answer this, one only ha to look at Hitler’s incursion into Europe before and during WW2. The Americans not only financed Hitler, but stood about watching Hitler and his army butcher their way through Poland, France and the rest of Europe. It wa not until the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbour that made the Americans do something, otherwise they would have done absolutely nothing. Britain would have been lost to the German force eventually, just through sheer numbers, and dwindling supply hit by U-boats. It is safe to say that the US would therefore be cautious in it initial action during a Russian and Chinese incursion. One must also not forget the other rogues, or variable in the mix. Iran and North Korea, who would most probably put to their advantage any weakness seen by the Western Allies. Iran, will attack Israel from all sides, and they will be joined by other Islamic states. This action alone will not mean the end of Israel, a the militarised state will hit back with all it might crushing the attacker ruthlessly. They will then push on further into Arab territory, gaining Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Lebanon and Iran. The other big dog of war who are itching for a fight are India and Pakistan, two nuclear capable countries. Who is to say they do not face off, maybe drop a nuke on Delhi and one on Islamabad? The aftermath of course would be cleaned up by China, a their million of troop surge into the region on the premise of ‘Keeping the Peace’. Back in the United Nations, there will be talk, but no solution, because there can be no solution to what is irresistible for many nations, holding back for so long. The delegate will know what they are dealing with, but it will be too late, and after the talking is over, there will be even more talking — a useless conversation to a very old question. World War 3 will not necessarily be nuclear. How about cyber warfare where million of Russian and Chinese hacker take down electricity grids/crucial utilities, or maybe an EMP burst in the upper atmosphere frying all electronic components, or what about satellite being blown up leaving many agency and the military blind? There are effective alternative to full nuclear war. No state in the world want to use their nuclear arsenal because this mean the territory they may conquer by conventional military warfare would be irradiated and useless. No one want a nuclear winter covering the sun for ten years, where all vegetation and animal die off. It is not in their interest for mutual self destruction, however many bunker they have. Therefore, it is safe to say that World War 3 will mainly be conventional warfare, however, if it come to an end scenario where one nuclear power is in serious danger of being wiped out conventionally, then, someone like Vladimir Putin will press the red button. His stance is that if Russia cease to exist, so should the others cease to exist. “But a a citizen of Russia, a a head of the Russian state, I want to ask – why do we need a world if Russia cease to exist?” The precursor for war is much like a rubber band. How far can one pull back a rubber band before it snap back into place? The natural circle and cycle of history for Mankind ha always been a state of war, and since the last major war in the late 1930s to 40s, the rubber band ha been stretching and stretching. Soon, the law of physic state that the rubber band will snap back into place, much like the tectonic plate suddenly snapping back after a major earthquake. Dwindling finite resource on earth, and increasing population mean that the final push for one singular faction to control all — is inevitable.',\n",
       " 'President Assad, otherwise known a the Butcher of Syria, who ha no qualm in gassing his own people, wa defiant after the pretty much useless bombing of some factory that were not in use, by the Allied force of Britain, France and the United States. “Chlorine is a very common chemical that anyone can get or make in large quantities. When we make barrel bomb to drop on civilian from our helicopter that is all we use. Therefore, what have the Allies done? Nothing much really, apart from bomb a few factory which we can rebuild anywhere else.” The defiant stance by Assad is in stark contrast to Donald Trump, who ha already declared victory with the seminal word seen once before “Mission Accomplished” uttered by the now retired failure, George W Bush. Apart from riling the already angry Russians, this bombing fiasco is not so much an answer to the recent gassing by whoever did it, but more of a cursory reconnaissance mission in Russian capability of revenge. “Ideally, the Russians will react to the bombing. This is what the Americans and ally want to see. They want to see what sort of vengeful reaction the Russians will have. This bombing wa ultimately not about Assad and his use of chemical weapon on civilians, but on how Vladimir Putin reacts. Most probably, the Russians will not take direct action but will take their vengeance the quiet silent way, i.e. a major hacking cyber attack, or maybe they will do other clandestine operation to destabilise the West. You see, the Russians prefer stealth to direct obtuse action. Overt reaction are too obvious,” a former agency analyst revealed on Monday. The only way to win the war in Syria is for the Allies to invade fully with boot on the ground. Naturally, this will never happen, simply because of Russian base present in the country.',\n",
       " 'A recent Nori poll questioned internet user on the censorious biased method of Google and Youtube staffers, revealing their pariah status excelling even that of traffic wardens. “We found that a whopping 94% of internet user now detest Google and YouTube so much that they actually prefer traffic wardens. Being a traffic warden is one of the worst job anyone can do in life, simply because the amount of negativity and hatred that come your way every day, well, Google and YouTube is now ahead of that and are even more hated than those pesky traffic warden handing out tickets,” poll manager, Allen Klein revealed. Not Evil One participant revealed that he used to like Google “before it turned evil” but now even the mere mention of the company make his skin crawl. “Google used to be seen a this friendly company back in the day, but once they got global domination and monopoly, their true colour shone through. Now if I even see the logo I start sweating and have to look away. It’s gotten so bad that I’m using the internet le now. I used to run some website but Google censored so much that nothing is left now and their monopoly over the world wide web is so pervasive that it’s nothing but a complete takeover.” The recent shooting spree at the Californian YouTube office because of the policy of unjustified censorship wa another indication that the tide ha firmly turned from favourable to extreme hatred. “When you take away someone’s livelihood, it sometimes mean that the person cracks. One only ha to study the 1993 film starring Michael Douglas – Falling Down, to see how thing can end up. This is what YouTube staff are doing day in day out, they’re censoring people’s right to free speech, their right to freedom of expression and ultimately their right to make revenue off of their video or websites. It is not only the totalitarian censorship that is disgusting but also the biased manner in which they do it,” another ex-YouTube user revealed. One other former YouTube Google user revealed: “After the way Google treated me and pretty much everyone I know; the other day when I got a ticket from a traffic warden, I frankly could not give a damn. It wa nothing compared to the way biased Google mistreats it users.”',\n",

What pundit on mainstream medium are writing about today, we already figured out in 2013, and we firmly stand by our analysis of the situation now a much a then. The West must be weary of the bear backed into a corner, a crossing the red line of Syria is a one way street with no return. Today, we have Donald Trump a president of the United States, who ha so far acted cautiously regarding any intrusion into Syria, even after the recent gassing by whoever did it. This is the question we must always ask, who did the deed? In a world where government happily hurt and murder their own citizen for their own political and geopolitical gains, nothing can be counted out. There is now no trust in any global government a their nefarious technique have too often been revealed. The news coming from Syria cannot be trusted a the mainstream medium is heavily tied to governmental rule and military intelligence propaganda.

Amongst the posturing, strutting ape paraded around the news desk barking for war, none of it should be believed. This is why the Daily Squib is so calm about the situation currently at hand, we simply do not believe anything will happen because the West is too fucking shit scared of Russia and the evil mastermind, Putin. If the alleged Assad gassing of civilian continues, nothing will be done again. We will of course get more baloney posturing but that’s it. The game is already won by Putin, his stranglehold of the region is complete, and Syria is the territorial global red line that cannot be crossed unless a fully fledged war ensues.

From the birth of the World Wide Web, these power nerd have created and grown company that are now monopoly controlling every facet of people’s lives. Smartphones, apps, search engines, social network – power nerd are in everything, their power increase daily a more million of people use their networks. Power nerd are ruthless, they are creature who do not balk in crushing their opponent completely without mercy and their greed for complete controlling power over everything is boundless. To quote a few example of company that are run by ruthless power nerds, we can of course cite Facebook, Twitter, Amazon and Google. These company are not only seeking to rule and control everything, they also are using their power to manipulate data taken from their platform to make money and increase their influence, a well a shut down any voice that are not left leaning. All Hail Zuckerberg “Power nerd are inherently evil. Zuckerberg is one example of a power nerd so power hungry that he pursues global domination with a vehement ruthless nasty streak. These tech robot are machines, they are not really human anymore, their fuel is pure power and more power, and they will use billion of people to achieve their goal at all cost. Tech power nerd are farmer of people, they farm billion of people for data,” an observer of the current situation revealed. Power nerd also do not have a problem about farming data from billion of people without their knowledge, they also abuse their position to be politically biased and censor free speech a a mean of gaining even more power. One can only hope that company like Facebook one day are brought to justice for their evil, devious crime committed against billion of people. In 2009, Facebook wa caught lying to their account holder about the amount and type of information it wa collecting on them, and the company also explicitly lied about who they were providing that information to. As a result, the Federal Trade Commission censured the company in 2011 for violation of Article 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The core mission of Article 5 of the FTC Act is to protect consumer welfare and prevent unfair business act or practice from occurring. In defiance of the Federal Trade Commission’s order, Facebook continued to reveal their customer private account information to unauthorized individual and corporation and is therefore liable for civil penalty of $41,484 per each violation – a fine that could reach $3 trillion Dollars. Talking about fines, Google, a company that control 91.5% of search traffic in Europe alone, is being slapped with antitrust fine from the EU, but it’s only for a measly £2.14 billion, which for a company that pay literally no tax, is peanuts. At the end of the day, these company led by power nerd have now spread their octopus-like grip over the whole globe, and to even begin deconstructing their evil plan of complete control, will be nearly impossible now unless these company are fined, broken up and told to pay the tax they owe. Hopefully one day the power nerd are put in their place, and we can all breathe a breath of fresh air on a free internet once again.',\n",

Usually the Windsors sup on boring old fodder. The Queen for example will break out the gin and Dubonnet before chowing down on grilled Dover sole with some sauteed veg on the side, you know maybe some spinach or a courgette. Certainly nothing starchy. Prince Charles, a boiled egg aficionado ha them served by a team of twenty servant who wait for approval of each egg presented to the prince. If an egg is slightly too runny or too hard, it fails the test and is discarded. The Duke of Edinburgh is rather partial to barbecue therefore he will fit in with American cuisine very well. Speaking exclusively to Marie Claire magazine, Meghan Markle revealed her intricate plan on introducing the royal to her roots. “My momma told me she always say ‘eat up yo collard greens’ and one day you grow up to be a beautiful princess. Sho nuff, imma qualified to be a bonafide as princess of royalty and live in a real goddamn palace wit’ servant and shiet! “First off, Imma stand up during lunch and axe da folk ‘Who’s up for some chitlins I be prepared sum earlier?’ and I know when they smell those chitlins they be salivating at the mouth fo sho! “Once they see the food we done prepare, hmm, hmm, just like momma cook, they will know what real eats is fo sho, honey! We got deep fry ham hock, black eye beans, pork brain and eggs, cornbread, rice covered in gravy with neck bones, all served up in one tasty bowl mixed in wit’ a stick.” Certainly, the Windsors are up for anything, and the introduction of African American soul food into the diet may be just the ticket for an altogether livelier atmosphere in the royal palace and court.',\n",

Statistics show that Tuesday last week saw a slight drop and only 40,000 fatality from murder occured. Londoner, Ed Corn, 45, say he only got stabbed three time on one day, and wa appreciative of the gesture. “I only got stabbed three times. One in the left buttock, one just above my liver, and the other a mere slash of the throat. Just missed the jug. It ha been like a holiday for me. I actually feel relieved.” Labour’s London is a dirty cesspit of violence and hatred Arthur Grenfell, said that living in the capital he wa all too appreciative of the current situation: “Living in London these days, an overcrowded cesspit of shit where every road space is filled with useless bus lanes, bike lane and lane for mobility scooters. The bus come in seven and are always empty, churning out vile fume into every pore of your body and up your filthy nostrils. The rude Eastern Europeans all with their unregistered vehicle hog the road and pavement fearless of ever getting a ticket. There are no road rule any more, there is no highway code, that went many year ago. The air smell like a festering tramp’s fresh diarrhoea explosion in your local library. London today is an expensive toilet where people pay through the nose to live in tiny squalid house if you can call them that, they pay through the nose to work in the capital, and invariably, they pay to die in it too.” Life in the capital today under Labour is such hell that getting stabbed or shot by a Yardie wannabe is actually a relief. “I wa shot four time on Thursday buying some jam from the local Sklep. It wa a relief actually because eventually when the ambulance came six hour later, they took me to a hospital 250 mile away from London. They said there were no bed in the hospital across the capital, apparently it a new EU initiative where they bring in million of people from the poorest country in the world to use up our resources.

       " 'You will give up your gun America, you will.. Analysing the current socialist medium push in America to repeal the Second Amendment is a sad affair. Here we have the network on 24 hour shift pushing out anti-gun propaganda on a constant loop, that is frankly tiresome and old. Then we have the university students, indoctrinated by their Marxist professors, and to top it all off, there’s the tech company and social medium effect where paid Soros shill a well a Chinese globalist operative constantly bleed out the anti-second amendment narrative. How do you destabilise a country from within? Divide it of course, and this is what China along with Russia are trying to do. Consider the fact, would you want a fully armed up population against you in any invasion? In Switzerland, it is mandatory that every citizen is armed, and this provides a good incentive to not invade. The collective moaning and sulking is not only tiresome to watch, but pitiful. It is however a technique used time and time again to change the view of the mass who are targeted. Amongst the useless march and lie-ins, nothing is achieved. No gun legislation will ever be achieved by peaceful mean in the U.S, so these misguided idiot are rallying just for the sake of rallying. Why not make it a day out in Washington D.C, see the sights, buy that smelly hotdog, then jump on the bandwagon for a few hour listening to communist speaker rally the useless troops? After the Obama Marxist reign, American socialist are even more of a joke, and to see them so triggered is proof that the majority are very easily controlled by their controllers. Most of the protester who shout for the ban of the AR-15 do not even know that it is a semi-automatic (i.e. it can only make one shot at a time). Fully automatic AR-15s are now banned, but this pass by the deranged ill informed protester who hold their placard up simply to feel like they are part of a crowd. If they knew they were marching for China, maybe they would think again, however many would probably appreciate the communist sentiment. Similar to sheep and lemmings, the socialist calling for the repeal of the Second Amendment right to bear arms, are following a mantra they simply do not understand, and they are completely clueless a to who is pulling the string behind the scenes. Banning doe nothing First of all, banning gun doe nothing, because then you have illegal weapons, and the trade for those will increase exponentially. Much like the drug trade, if one ban something, it gain value. Traffickers are begging for gun control, because that mean they will have sole distribution rights. One only ha to look at Prohibition in the 1920s. The Mafia made billion in today’s money after alcohol wa banned in the United States for a period of time. Secondly, why stop at guns? Cars kill, knife kill and if you do it right so can a ballpoint pen. Do you want these thing banned too? Thirdly, trying to take away a real Americans’ gun is akin to taking away their right to defend themselves or their families. This right is so ingrained in American society and culture that it will take a civil war to achieve. Naturally, the first people who will be shot in an another American civil war will be the dweeb who don’t like gun and protested against them. What do you think will happen when every gun toting American suddenly wake up to what is happening? It’s gonna be trigger time. A lot of Americans are positively itching for the gun grab to happen, because they know where the unarmed anti-gun people live. Civil war would be like hunting season all over again, except this time substitute the jack rabbit for the Hogg stooge and his brainwashed commie compatriots. Looting, fucking, shooting, and cold blooded murder, the whole shithouse will go up in flame overnight. Like lighting a match under a firework factory, astronaut will be able to watch the whole shooting spree from the space station all the way up there in orbit. As for the U.K, banning gun wa no big deal simply because it never had a gun culture ingrained a much a Americans. The docile British are so well controlled that they happily pay a much tax a possible without even complaining. In America, that just would not stand, and the people would make thing happen one way or another. The exact is opposite in the U.K. where every indignity and non-freedom is accepted willingly by the populace without so much a a whimper. America wa built by the gun. Maybe, it will die by the gun.',\n",

Speaking from his dacha in New Malden, the ex-spy revealed his final solution for the Jews. “Stalin, is a great hero of mine. He put million of Jews into the gulag in Siberia where they perished from hard work and certain starvation. When I am leader, I will solve the Jew problem by putting them all in gulag in Northern Britain, which some say is a worse fate than being in Siberia.” The Great Purge Now that Labour is aligned with anti-semitic policies, when it get into power, it will purge Britain of Jews a it view them a zionist infiltrator to the Soviet British cause. Momentum, a radical arm of the Labour party will spearhead the purge initiative, by disseminating anti-Jewish propaganda. The Labour party under Jeremy Corbyn will thus rid Britain of Jews, such is their vitriol and hatred towards them. Much like Stalin, who murdered million of Jews, so too will Corbyn follow in his steps. After the foundation of Israel in May 1948, and it alignment with the USA in the Cold War, the 2 million Soviet Jews, who had always remained loyal to the Soviet system, were portrayed by the Stalinist regime a a potential fifth column and labelled Enemy of the People. Despite his personal dislike of Jews, Stalin had been an early supporter of a Jewish state in Palestine, which he had hoped to turn into a Soviet satellite in the Middle East. But a the leadership of the emerging state proved hostile to approach from the Soviet Union, Stalin became increasingly afraid of pro-Israeli feeling among Soviet Jews. His fear intensified a a result of Golda Meir’s arrival in Moscow in the autumn of 1948 a the first Israeli ambassador to the USSR. On her visit to a Moscow synagogue on Yom Kippur, thousand of people lined the streets, many of them shouting Am Yisroel chai (‘The people of Israel live!’)—a traditional affirmation of national renewal to Jews throughout the world but to Stalin a dangerous sign of ‘bourgeois Jewish nationalism’ that subverted the authority of the Soviet state. Stalin’s response wa to remove many prominent Jews from public office, albeit quietly, and send thousand to gulag where they simply disappeared. The irony is that it wa the Jewish Bolsheviks who had played a very important role in the Soviet cultural revolution in the first place, however under Stalin, they were now deemed the Enemy of the People. He also made sure that any cultural reference to Jewish people or the state of Israel would be shut down, including museum and cultural centres. Much like Stalin, Corbyn detests anything that is linked with Western democracy, and it is unfortunate for the Jews that they are a scapegoat now a much a in Stalin’s day.',\n",

You empty a clip, your reload time may be a life or death situation, this is why you need to reload fast, and have many magazine available for the next burst of fire, this is all about gun control. Collateral damage, this is acceptable in the military but on the street or home can get you locked up for good, therefore when you’re aiming, get the right target (the bad guy) for fuck’s sake. Gun control is a very important aspect of this situation otherwise you could end up with multiple instance of collateral damage. What about jamming? If your weapon of choice is not properly maintained, cleaned and oiled, then you will get more instance of your firearm jamming due to fouling. You don’t want that to happen if you’re in a serious life threatening situation and firing a fully automatic or semi auto weapon. Revolvers are generally more reliable, but they still need to be maintained and under gun control. Gun control is also about what gauge you use with your weapon. What can you handle well? Know your limits. It’s a toss up between blowing major hole in somebody or something or getting that accurate clean head shot into the cranium with little or no recoil. Practice, practice, practice! If you don’t practice with your gun, you won’t know how to control the gun. This is why access to a good shooting range is invaluable. Don’t forget, gun control is not only about controlling the gun but most of all controlling yourself. If someone cut in line at the fast food restaurant, just let it go, sure you can say a few words, maybe have a fist fight, but no gun will be needed there. Gun control is mostly about responsibility. You should only ever use your weapon when in serious fear of your life, and mostly on your own property to protect your family and yourself. Hopefully with these tips, you will adhere to good gun control and live a long happy life of liberty including the Second Amendment’s right to bear arms.

F or American invitee to the wedding of his Royal Highness, the Prince of Wales and Ms. Meghan Markle at the chapel in Windsor Castle, these careful word of advice are hereinafter given to provide some pointer to avoid gaffe on your part. “Hi, buddy” is not considered a proper greeting to the Prince, nor “Hi, there” to Meghan. With the British, first name are not used at once a if you are drinking pals. In the case of the Prince and Meghan, this mean you cannot address them a “Harry” and “Meghan” (let alone, “Har” and “Meg”). If the conversation becomes boring, it is not considered normal behavior to begin fingering object at the reception and checking their bottom for prices. An occasional nod of the head will give the impression of paying attention. Appraising the women’s leg is a no-no. When tea is served, a it invariably is, it will be brought in a cup. Nor should the saucer which accompanies the cup be considered an unnecessary accoutrement; the saucer should not be waived away with distain, nor should you say you prefer “a brew” instead. The little finger should not be pointed (and certainly never at the prince or the bride) but curled in raising the cup, and the index finger should not be extended in lieu thereof, even in emphasizing a conversational point. Actually, point are not emphasized in England, rather they are nudged into place. Napkins are also served, and the mouth should be patted, never swiped at. Sweeping gesture are frowned on. The last sweeping gesture made by an Englishman wa that of Sir Walter Raleigh in spreading his cloak for Queen Elizabeth (the First) to walk on, and he subsequently lost his head. The English are a reticent race. Do not pepper them with a lot of rapid-fire talk. On the other hand, you may doze until they finish their sentences, and mumbling is also tolerated, which facilitates answering them if you are in the midst of a tart which the English dote on. Do not ask for a Big Mac instead. The English cannot abide shouting, so your normal speaking voice must be modulated.

       " 'Where will this mass censorship drive by left wing tech company end? The internet is slowly being purged of free thought and freedom of expression by monopoly company that control 95% of everything now on the world wide web. All there is is silence. No one apart from a few site and people are speaking up or doing anything about it. Well if you don’t stand up for your rights, then one day you will be next, one day you will be censored, demonetized and deleted, or relegated to page 3,000 in search. Who will speak up for you then? NO ONE! As well a Martin Niemöller’s word that ring so true in this insane Orwellian age, we can also mention Edmund Burke who famously stated — “The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.” How ironic that Google once said that it’s motto was: “Don’t be Evil” Just a Google ha censored our satire and parody so too is China. In retrospect, what is happening right now is beyond evil, because what these monopoly tech company and their extreme leftist policy are doing is in fact aligning with communist Chinese censorship and it destructive dictatorial ideology. And here we thought we lived in a functioning Western democracy where we had right of free speech? Alas, the tech company like twitter, facebook and google have demonstrated otherwise by inhibiting our fundamental right to human expression and freedom. THIS WILL NOT END WITH US – YOU ARE NEXT Our brand of Juvenalian satire ha been punished so severely that we can barely write anything or post a picture without Google punishing our site. Such are the length they go to to censor satire, a literary genre borne from the beginning of mankind’s history. How would Decimus Iūnius Iuvenālis have dealt with the Google push against real satire and free speech on the internet? No doubt, he would have reacted with great disgust. Not only at the punishers of free speech but at the medium companies, the authors, the writers, the politician and supposed guardian of democracy who are NOW silent. Even so-called upholder of investigative journalism and satire, Private Eye, who are now merely establishment BBCified stooge towing the line are silent. You are pathetic in your silence, but one day, you may hark back to this moment and realise you were wrong and cowardly. Berners Lee? Where is he? Nowhere to be seen. All we know is, the Daily Squib stood up. We will fight them to the end, to the end of the universe, to the end of time, and to the end of every sinew, every muscle group and every fucking last drop of our spittle for our right to write satire and parody. cartoon: Damien Glez http://glez.org/',\n",

Fishermen and Tory MPs took part in the protest after the Government caved to demand from Brussels that Britain remain in the Common Fisheries Policy until 31 December 2020. The climbdown over the transition deal mean that the UK will be subject to quota imposed on British fisherman from the EU for an additional 21 months.

Sarkozy is in custody a part of an investigation that he received million of euro in illegal financing from the regime of the late Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi, according to a judicial source. “I told him, he need to clean the money. Sarko, would not listen to me and deposited the million in a French bank. He thought he wa untouchable because he wa part of the French elite,” a former associate revealed. Though an investigation ha been underway since 2013, the case gained traction some three year later when French-Lebanese businessman Ziad Takieddine told the online investigative site, Mediapart, that he delivered suitcase from Libya containing 5 million euro in cash to Sarkozy and his former chief of staff Claude Gueant. Investigators are examining claim that Gadhafi’s regime secretly gave Sarkozy 50 million euro overall for the 2007 campaign. Such a sum would be more than double the legal campaign funding limit at the time of 21 million euros. In addition, the alleged payment would violate French rule against foreign financing and declaring the source of campaign funds.

       " 'Hormones are chemical produced by the body. They are very small, however powerful, and lack or excess of them can cost one health. Hormones directly influence the majority of organ and tissues, physical and chemical processes, even state of mind and emotions. For example, the most powerful hormone in the human body are: Adrenaline; Testosterone, Human Growth Hormone; Estrogen; Insulin; Cortisol. When these or other hormone are disbalanced, hormone replacement therapy is one of the treatment options. Hormones can be provided in pills, injections, patches, etc. While some people believe that having a diagnosis and knowing what hormone is lacking or in excess is enough to go an buy a medicine on their own, this is totally incorrect. To provide proper treatment, year of experience and profound knowledge in medical field are needed. So, to buy proper pills, patch or injections, go to https://www.hgha.com/ and consult a doctor first. it may even turn out that what you believe is endocrine system problem is actually not, and additional intake of hormone will ruin your health even more. Why You Can’t Get Injection Of Your Own Choice In order to attract clients, pharmaceutical company started to produce different injection that aim to increase the level of certain hormone in the body. The patient who need injection can theoretically buy those and do injection at home, without need to visit the clinic. However, these injection are and should be sold only after proper research, analysis and calculation of dosage. Here are some reason why you should not get injection without doctor’s prescription: To decide what injection is correct, the doctor ha to make a full medical screening. In order to improve the level of hormone in the body, any injection dosage is not the option. The process can only be changed in a needed way if the component of injection correspond to particular body needs. You can’t calculate the dosage yourself. General prescription are not enough. Each patient’s endocrine profile is different. You have to consult the doctor if you want to get the medicine that will really help you. The efficiency and influence of hormone should be constantly supervised and the indication should be measured, to check the progress and adjust the treatment plan if needed. The dosage may need to be changed already in two weeks, or another medication should be offered. Without proper education and experience, a patient cannot conduct such observation. These reason show that you can only get the injection by doctor’s prescription. Otherwise, you will simply ruin your health. What Doctor To Address Not all endocrinologist who work in clinic are able to prescribe the right hormone treatment, in other words, only being a doctor in a clinic is not enough. A professional doctor ha to have year of practice in the field, having worked specifically a endocrinologist. The doctor also ha to have appropriate certification from relevant authority confirming him a a specialist. medical diploma is not yet an indicator of proper knowledge and skills. It is always a good idea to ask your friend about contact of a good doctor; the word of mouth is a good recommendation in this case. If the doctor or clinic is awful, people will readily tell you so. The treatment methods, medication and approach also develop constantly. The scientist discover new options, and modern doctor have to be posted about the innovations. Pharmaceutical company develop new product that have to be checked, tested, certified, assessed, modified, and doctor take part in all that, too. Therefore, the doctor ha to be really experienced to provide proper diagnosis, treatment plan and patient support. Choose your doctor and clinic wisely.',\n",

There are so many Russians in Britain today, that’s the only language I usually hear when in the streets, but I can’t learn it.

Vladimir Sikorsky, a Russian embassy envoy wa on hand to explain the fine detail of the move. “You need hats. In Moscow it very cold. Also, you need to be able to drink large quantity of vodka without falling down. Us Russian, we can drink three bottle a day without getting tipsy, but you British will have to learn the Russian way. Also, you have to know about food shopping, in our shop food very expensive, only VIP oligarch can shop there. In some Moscow markets, one tomato is equivalent to £7.50.” Jeremy Corbyn, however, ha sought to calm the nerve of his staff and followers. “Comrades, a your supreme Agent Cob, I wish to assuage any form of terror you may be feeling right now when I announced the Moscow move.

One twitter user, 98Arbunkin wa certain that the #MeToo generation of #snowflakes were more of a danger to themselves with their constant moaning and groaning. “Why don’t they just shut up.

Get over yourselves for fuck’s sake.” Professor Giles Timberlik, a social medium expert at the University of Kentucky Fry in Austin, Texas, ha conducted data driven study into the #MeToo phenomenon of caterwauling women. “It’s simply a way for the hysterical bag of oestrogen to moan about men by using twitter to put the spotlight on the person who us the hashtag to moan about men. Like look at me I am one of you, I don’t like men either. Hey, look at my profile. Look at me. Look at my beautiful assortment of selfies.” Attention whore This is why paying attention to the #metoo poster is adding fuel to the fire. It is in fact taking women’s right back to the stone age. “I just won’t employ woman any more. It’s that simple. I need people that work, don’t get pregnant and don’t moan about the simplest of thing like complimenting her, or asking her out on a date. If they don’t want to be employed, it’s their problem, not mine,” a video production suite manager, who deal with many Hollywood production told LAWeek magazine.

This is why a ground war with Russia would be a fait accomplis for the crumbling old facade of the poverty stricken rabble that is the Russian army. Yes, Putin can always threaten complete nuclear annihilation of the earth with his grandiose killer missiles, but even he doe not want that. His aim, even if it is deluded, is to conquer the West intact so he can be the ultimate Czar of the world with Russian supremacy over all. Modernization need money, and this is where Russia ultimately fall down. The country, now an International pariah, is sanctioned to the hilt, and it primary revenue stream are diverted by corrupt oligarch offshore. “Our unit ha two rifle to practice with. I asked my commanding officer what would happen in combat, and he told me that we would have to share the old Soviet rifle together, maybe one chap take a shot, then another might think he can do better. So you pas the rifle around the unit, or if someone is killed and he is holding the rifle, you pick it up and carry on until the whole unit perishes,” Sergei Olkov, a private in Russia’s second division stationed in the Northeastern Group in the Kamchatka Peninsula revealed. To go into battle with today’s modern force would mostly be suicide for the poor Russian conscripts, who are so ill trained, they don’t even have the capacity to understand the basic battle tactic or maneuver most other force utilise to win over the enemy. Only about a quarter of Russian ground force are fully staffed, well-trained professional troops. The rest are a mishmash of unit put together, some don’t even have uniforms, and serve in their tracksuits. They have never even fired live weapon or had access to specialist military equipment. One only ha to look at the graveyard of Afghanistan to see the abandoned Soviet tank and Migs, revealing the reality of how poorly performing the Russians were even when fighting old men in hut carrying 19th century single shot rifles. “The Russian boy would be seen frolicking around in their camps, they run around naked, drunk, slapping each others butts, and doing god know what to each other. When they came out to patrol once a week, I would shoot one round into the sky. Then they would run away with real fear in their eyes. To us, these were not men but girls,” a Pashtun warrior chief, recalled. Naturally, Putin only sent the cream of the crop to the recent Syrian conflict a a showcase for the world’s media, however these only make up one percent of the current Russian army. What of the conflict in Ukraine? Putin cannot even advance from the small pocket of land he ha illegally occupied, a his troop are so weak. All the talk about Russia this, Russia that. It’s all hysteria, smoke and mirrors. There is no threat from Russia on the ground or in the air. If the West wanted to, they could cut through Russia faster than a babushka cut through her tepid cabbage soup with a mouldy wooden spoon. How about a trip on the ageing only Russian aircraft carrier, the Soviet-era Admiral Kuznetsov. Basically it is an old rust bucket which break down frequently and need it own tug to tow it back to shore on practically every voyage it go on. This some say is why Russians drink so much vodka, because inherently they are cowards, and have to be so drunk to even get the gut to pick up a weapon let alone shoot it.',\n",

We found that when a plant is uprooted from the earth it ha stood in from seed, the plant let off a high pitched sound above any human register, along with electrical impulses. This reaction led u to hypothesise that the plant wa not happy about being uprooted and wa in effect screaming for it life. “We then moved on to vegetable being first cut, then eaten. We attached a series of meter and electrical signal sequencer to each vegetable. The noisiest scream and electrical impulse came from a tomato. Each cut of the blade through it flesh would register a shock impulse denoting extreme distress, then when the tomato wa put in the mouth and slowly chewed the distress signal increased until slowly ebbing away. “Bananas being peeled are in pain. It is akin to skinning a living animal. Scraping the skin off carrots, we registered the yelp of pain and distress. Putting fruit in a blender however resulted in no electrical impulse or sound, because death came quickly.” Salad It is thought that meat eater are the cruel ones, but think about those grapes, maybe that slice of lemon, or that watermelon you just sliced and diced.

Recently, the monopolistic tech company like Google and Facebook started to clamp down on free speech, freedom of expression, satire, and other form of literature. This totalitarian policy wa once only seen in China’s communist dictatorship, and censoring regime. Put two and two together and you have globalism led by China. This mean that the tech company are actually following Chinese communistic technique in limiting freedom of speech, censorship and dictating what people can and cannot say. Therefore, one can see that there is a shift to soviet communism by the tech companies, who are pandering to China’s globalistic aspiration to take over the West. The tech company are not doing this only for money, but one suspect that they actually subscribe to Chinese communist doctrine. In relation to the communist doctrine that encapsulates China, some tech company even happily report dissident to Chinese authorities. Twitter and Google have both done this, which resulted in the dissident disappearing, never to be seen again. The Chinese authority can only get the data about someone’s details, from Twitter or Google, therefore they collaborate with the communist regime in arresting individual who are critical of the state. China’s awful human right record is of course glossed over when it come to profit, and so is the treatment of Tibetans who have been tortured, killed and displaced by the brutal communist Chinese state. Imagine being abducted and whisked away to a cell where you spend the next several month or year with no charge or conviction, and your organ harvested.

Like, say I want to see my girlfriend’s left kidney or ovaries, just type it up on our Google Maps app, and you will have all the photo there.” Asked whether the new internal body mapping initiative is a bit intrusive, Google denied any invasion of privacy. “It is our policy to map every part of the globe, and you a a human inhabit that sphere of data input. This is not an invasion of privacy but a right that our company is entitled to.” The body map will go all the way up to the brain. That’s a long way to go from your rectum. Yowzer!',\n",

Michael Trimbell, who run an anti-terror unit for different agencies, ha revealed that Agent Cob is “a master in poison techniques, learned from his Cold War day spying for the Russians”. “Russian spies, and Agent Cob’s Czech handler would have trained Agent Cob in various technique to clandestinely kill adversary without detection. This included concocting poison from everyday materials, then depositing it in the target’s drink. Agent Cob, would then watch from afar a his mark either keeled over on the spot or swerved around like a drunk. These technique are utilised by today’s FSB, and yesterday’s KGB very successfully.” KGB operative could incapacitate opponent by usage of aerosol spray containing lethal cocktail of dangerous toxic gas or from afar with a silent air gun shooting a needle infused with poison into the victim. The tiny needle would enter the skin undetected, then dissolve. Once the poison get into the bloodstream it kill the victim by stopping the heart, then dissipates without any trace, leaving doctor and forensic scientist labelling the death a a simple natural heart attack. “One minute you’re walking along the High Street, the next your blood pressure drops, and you’re out of breath sweating like a pig. Then your heart stops. Voom!

Here is an ex-Soviet spy who leaked secret to the Soviets in the 1980s, and not only is he among u MPs, he is also the leader of the Labour party.

       " 'source: max pixel A ccording to a recently published study of 2,000 US adults, there is one topic that is really taboo when it come to dating, and that topic is money. The statistic show that the vast majority are unwilling to discus this, with most claiming they would much prefer to discus other taboo subjects, such a politics and religion, in order to avoid talking about it altogether. Helen Fisher, the chief scientific advisor behind the research, suggested that online daters just don’t want to have that all-important money talk, with the only associated topic they’re comfortable discussing being their career. Keeping quiet about our cash Source: Max Pixel The study in question focused on respondent who were either actively using a dating platform or had met their partner online at Badoo or something similar. When questioned about the subject they felt comfortable exploring, the vast majority felt similarly about their finance i.e. that they were ‘not comfortable at all’ sharing this information with those they met. The number were revealing, with 69 percent claiming they would not wish to disclose information about any debts, and the same number clarifying that they would want to keep their credit score to themselves. 64 percent also said that they weren’t comfortable sharing their income, with 53 percent saying the same of their spending habits. Even more revealingly, perhaps, 18 percent believed that discussing their finance had led to previous break-ups. Fisher suggests that this is because money tends to be a very personal topic, one that “says so much about you.” Expanding on this statement, the study’s lead posited that, for all of us, it is a way of getting clue about our partner, helping u to build a better picture of what they’ll be like a a parent, friend, and significant other. A close-lipped society Source: Max Pixel Given the importance of the topic, one might argue that – discomfort aside – it is essential to talk about it, yet one in five Americans never have such a conversation with their other half. Unfortunately for them, this can have a highly detrimental impact on their monetary health. As expert Greg Heller explains: “The major benefit of speaking about money is getting the subject out in the open.” He argues that this can help to engender a sense of relief, in that people are able to not only discus their situation, but also any fear or financial insecurity they might have. This sharing can help them to make better decisions, set obtainable goals, and work together a a team to build a stronger financial future. This is a view that Discover’s Kate Manfred agrees with, suggesting that it’s vital to talk about money early on in order to ensure your outlook align. With it playing such a large part in serious relationships, it mean that you can get onto the same page from the start and don’t have to worry about running into problem further down the line.

This 4m2f contest is hugely popular a once a year, punter love placing a bet on this race, regardless of whether they choose form, colour or a name to make their selection. Here is an early look at the horse that stand out from the entry for the 2018 renewal next month. Total Recall The bookmaker look to have got the betting right for the Grand National this year a Total Recall top the betting at 10/1 to come out on top over the big fence at Aintree and it is really hard to oppose him. The Ladbrokes Trophy winner ha won all three of his start this season and he is trained by the maestro himself, Willie Mullins. This Irish raider could improve for the step up in trip and with Ruby Walsh, who will be seeking his third Grand National winner, on his back in the race, there is so much to like about him. Definitly Red One of the classiest horse to the Grand National field this year is Definitely Red a his form this season is good enough for him to take his chance at the Cheltenham Festival, where he ha been backed into 10/1 in the Cheltenham Gold Cup betting. If he is unable to prevail at the Festival, don’t rule him out to gain compensation at Aintree a he should love the stamen test the race presents. Brian Ellison’s chaser ha already had two fantastic win so far in the season a he wa successful in the Many Clouds Chase and Cotswold Chase. At nine year old, he is the perfect age to have a shot at the feature race at Aintree, where he is a big a 20/1. The Last Samuri The Last Samuri went close to slaying his rival in the 2016 Grand National when he finished second in the 40 runner field behind Rule the World. Last year’s attempt wa not quite a good, however, a he got around the course again. In four attempt over the Grand National fences, The Last Samuri ha always finished his race; he is a very reliable operator. With a bit of luck this year, he could well be the first past the post. At 20/1 in the betting, he represents one of the best each-way bet next month. Vicente Vicente is a two-time Scottish Grand National winning after landing the race at Ayr in 2016 and 2017, which show he ha the stamen for the four-mile plus race on the calendar in the UK and Ireland. Unfortunately, Paul Nicholls’ runner did not participate for long last year a he came down at the very first fence after making a mistake. If you can forgive that error, he is very much overpriced at 33/1. The nine-year-old often produce his best form at the back end of the season so hopefully, he can come good at Aintree this time around. The 2018 Grand National take place on April 14, but betting is already open on the race if you want to get your money down early.',\n",

If Corbyn saw that Mrs Thatcher had not worn any underwear, by utilising his Soviet mirror gadget, he would hoot like an owl, then scratch his crotch four time whilst moving backwards. One of Corbyn’s contacts, Agent 9, would hold a red book in his hand whenever they met. This signal meant that it wa okay to talk freely, however if he held a black book, this would mean that they had to go elsewhere to converse. Corbyn wa also trained in stealth techniques, a well a military grade combat. His shoe were specially fitted with spike laced with deadly poison, and would be deployed by clicking the heel three times. As a last resort, Agent Cob wa also given a cyanide pill just in case he wa ever found out by the British secret service and interrogated.',\n",
       " 'Former Cold War Soviet spy, Comrade Corbyn is angry with the medium after being outed a an informant to Soviet Russia recently. Speaking at his dacha in Islington, the supreme leader of the Labour party said that “changes would be coming” to press freedom. Analyst, Borgmer Lynns, revealed the truth of Corbyn’s deadly message. “What Corbyn is effectively saying is he will squash press freedom and make Britain look like Soviet Russia, or Stasi East Germany during the Cold War. Seeing a he wa a spy for the Soviets, a recalled by Czech spy, Jan Sarkocy, who recruited Corbyn in the 1980s, he ha a real affinity for the machination of the Cold War era. He want to introduce it into Britain with mass censorship and threats.” Pravda The Corbyn press model would be to nationalise all newspapers, where all editorial decision would have to go through a central Soviet committee linked to the Labour party. This is already occurring with the BBC, who after a week of medium report of Corbyn’s spy past had been revealed, had still barely acknowledged the news, and refused to report on it so a to protect their leader and party chief. The BBC is the official voice of the Labour party and support it soviet ideal with extreme passion. The office of the Pravda newspaper were transferred to Moscow on March 3, 1918 when the Soviet capital wa moved there. Pravda became an official publication, or “organ”, of the Soviet Communist Party. Pravda became the conduit for announcing official policy and policy change and would remain so until 1991. Subscription to Pravda wa mandatory for state run companies, the armed service and other organization until 1989. Other newspaper like the Daily Telegraph, Daily Mail, the Sun, the Times, and Express, would be ordered to tow the Labour soviet line or force being shut down. If Labour come into power under Comrade Corbyn, many would flee the former nation of Britain and take their business to place where democracy still resides.',\n",
       " 'With news that Peter Thiel, like other billionaire are setting up safe haven away from everything in case of economic and financial collapse in the West are sadly mistaken. When the collapse comes, there will be complete disorder and chaos. Banks will shut, all social security will stop, and all emergency service will eventually be forced to stop after being inundated. Naturally, disorder and collapse of all financial service will result in rioting in the street accompanied with mass looting of all business and rich people in their homes. No food and water for three day will make any population, however civilised beforehand, into wild savages. One must remember that disorder in the West, is a trigger for the West’s enemy to strike. Therefore, China, Iran, N.Korea and Russia would capitalise on the chaos. Striking while your enemy is at his weakest is a sure way for success in any military attack. The precept for invasion could also be cloaked in aiding the West, where they move troop in to keep order on the premise of helping whichever nation they are invading. South China Sea and All That This is why New Zealand, and Australia, which are only a ship ride away from China would be one of the first place to be attacked. China ha had it eye on Australia for some time, and who is to say they won’t have an eye on New Zealand a well? Peter Thiel, and his billionaire friend would thus be rounded up just like everyone else and sent to re-education camp or communist Chinese gulags. Remember that the Chinese are desperate for land, and Australia/New Zealand have plenty for it needs. When it come to swarm warfare, China win hand down, nothing will get in their way, and the million of fighting men and woman of the Chinese military are a formidable force. The billionaire who are buying plot of land in New Zealand now can only be labelled a misinformed idiot with too much money and no sense. Are you that fucking stupid, blinded by your rich that you do cannot see the immediate threat lying directly above Australia? Idiots.',\n",
       " 'Agent Cob - License to Spill (secrets) The Broccoli family insisted that ex-soviet spy MP, Jeremy Corbyn should be cast a the arch villain in the new James Bond film. “We were going to do the film about Spectre, but after seeing the news about Jezza being a soviet spy in the eighties, right under everyone’s noses, we were intrigued. He is still an MP and leader of the Labour party and is sincerely hoping to seize revolutionary Bolshevik power soon. Old Jezza could take over the world and change it into some sort of communist collectivist allotment where everyone grows prize courgette and marrow year in year out,” Cubby Broccoli’s niece, Jennifer Lettuce, told the Times. The plot change for the film ha been quite time consuming for the writer but when opportunity like this arise, one ha to seize the bull by the horns, or in Jeremy Corbyn’s words, the Czech spy by the cheque book. Jeremy Corbyn wa allegedly paid a measly sum of £10,000 for the information he handed over to the soviet in the 1980s, but in the film, he will be demanding over a million quid. This money is then funnelled into a cultist secretive group called Momentum. “The secret to a good Bond film is always the villain. This is why Jeremy Corbyn will be ideal, because he ha actually lived the life of a spy. Daniel Craig, who is meant to be James Bond hasn’t ever met a real spy before, and he is really chuffed about working with Jeremy,” the film’s director, Johnson Marx, told medium outlet on Monday.',\n",

       " 'Soweto, South Africa today The new Black Panther film is atrocious, and no one with any standard should go and see it, unless you catch it on an internet streaming site for free. People should not fund such a ridiculous racially divisive film which glorifies black supremacy and racism entertwined in impossible fantasy. In the isolationist fictional world of Wakanda; no immigration is allowed, the city ha large wall around it, is a homogeneous ethno-state where only black people are allowed, and promotes black supremacy over all other races. Just reverse the colour and you get Trump’s vision of America. Amongst this utopian fantasy world life black superheros with insane technology that can only be dreamed of, and is not close to reality in any way. Who designed this technological cornucopia of immense intricacy and superior advancement? The Wakanda crew can barely string a sentence together let alone create anti-gravity tech or nano suit which defy the law of physics. The reality of Africa is that it is a continent of great resource but poor function. There is huge poverty in the continent and a film like this is a disgrace to Africans. It is essentially saying, if we were clever enough we could have the technology of the West within this fantasy but we don’t, the reality thus bite even more, and insult the African state of today who have very little technological advancement or technical knowhow. Apart from the brilliant Blade series, the only real black superhero seen on screen ha to be ‘Ghost Dog’ with Forest Whitaker, who wa not essentially a Marvel superhero but one of superhuman strength and intellect, thanks to diligent study of the Hagakure. Okay, Forest took the pay cheque for Black Panther, but we should not begrudge him on that. The director of Black Panther, Ryan Coogler, is obviously a black supremacist a can be seen in all his previous efforts, and his vision is one of complete domination of all by the black race. This is therefore not about equality, but supremacy, and where all other race are subjugated by the ‘superior’ black race. In essence, if this film were made of a race other than black, it would be panned a deeply racist, however because there is a special card for African Americans, it is instead lauded, and promoted a the next big thing since sliced bread. Double standard for African Americans, mixed in with hypocrisy and affirmative action. Don’t go and see this fantasy film that disregard everything about African reality, instead please give to the many aid charity in Africa who really need the help.

       " 'Why are people surprised that Jeremy Corbyn gave away British secret and crucial information to the Soviets in the 1980s? Certainly, here is a man who is a staunch Marxist who want to come into power and create a Soviet dictatorship in the UK. “Mr Sarkocy, who wa expelled from the UK by Margaret Thatcher and now life in Bratislava, said that the information revealed by the MP – whose codename wa Agent Cob – wa “rated in Moscow a the number one”. Source: DT One can only imagine the amount of state secret Comrade Corbyn handed over to the Soviets during the eighties, however one thing is sure, the people who are supporting Corbyn are supporting someone who is a danger to national interest and ha allegedly caused great harm to the UK in the past by collaborating with it enemies. Should something be done about this? Well, of course, but it seems the sanitised MI6 are just sitting on their fingers, and everyone else is brushing it under the carpet. In the last elections, when Corbyn nearly came to power, Sir Richard Dearlove, the former head of MI6, warned that “Mr Corbyn could not be trusted a prime minister and that, rather than be allowed to run the security services, he would previously have been investigated by them.” Is anyone going to act on the new information that ha come to light? Surely, someone or some agency, or some entity must investigate further, and bring Corbyn to justice. Naturally, this news ha not been reported by the BBC. You can’t have a former Soviet spy running the country, especially someone who sought to harm Britain by giving away information that put u in danger. Anyone out there? Anyone?',\n",

       " 'Investigative journalist Sharyl Attkinson ha revealed after extensive research into the Fake News purge on many site across the internet, that Google’s former CEO, Eric Schmidt wa the mastermind behind it all. His modus operandi wa to smear any news site that held alternative view to the democrats, and Hillary Clinton during and after the 2016 election. Our site ha suffered a lot from Google’s bias because satire wa wrongly labelled a ‘fake news’, and we were numerously threatened by Google, to remove satirical material or face the consequences. We have also been demonetized and shadow banned on YouTube. Our site wa also ejected from Google news feed during the fake news fiasco. “Digging deeper, she discovered that Google wa one of the big donor behind First Draft’s “fake news” messaging. Google’s parent company, Alphabet, wa run by Eric Schmidt, who happened to be a huge Hillary Clinton supporter. Schmidt “offered himself up a a campaign adviser and became a top multi-million donor to it. His company funded First Draft around the start of the election cycle,” Attkisson said. “Not surprisingly, Hillary wa soon to jump aboard the anti-fake news train and her surrogate David Brock of Media Matters privately told donor he wa the one who convinced Facebook to join the effort.” Attkisson declared that “the whole thing smacked of the roll-out of a propaganda campaign.” The Daily Squib surmised itself that the Fake News scheme wa a way for the democrat to purge any form of alternative or conservative thought through censorship and labelling it a fake news. We never thought however that Google would be behind all of this, and are frankly disgusted, but not surprised. This whole sorry fake news debacle just show the inherent power Google ha over the internet and how it us it power for the purpose of bias, corruption and censorship of large swathe of internet website for it own ends. One thing about free speech is that every viewpoint should be heard, however much one disagrees with any viewpoint, it ha a right to be heard. Censorship and bias thwart the true tenet of democracy. By trying to artificially skew thought and literature, one dwells into the world of totalitarianism and dictatorship, essentially what Google ha become. The only good thing about Google at the moment is Ray Kurzweil, who we are great fan of, and hope he is using his job to really move thing forward in a positive way.

The alleged ANTIFA member, adopted the communist, Marxist ideology utilised by the far left group which is supported by George Soros, Hillary Clinton, the Obamas, and other important American democrats. The killing spree started when Cruz set off the fire alarm so he could shoot more people funnelling through the corridors. As Cruz wa a member of ANTIFA, and clearly supported their extreme left-wing communist ideology there are several motif for his actions. Firstly, ANTIFA is about disarming Americans, they are anti-gun, therefore what better way to bring up the anti-gun message again with another school massacre, secondly, he could have been targeting conservative students, especially Trump supporters, thirdly, he wa angry at being expelled.

       " 'I f you got to grip with writing your university paper and after an hour of work got stuck on the first paragraph, don’t worry, you are not the only who experience difficulty with written assignments.

There are quite a few reason why. It might be hard to write on a given topic. First of all, not every theme is to your liking. Sometimes you are assigned to write about something which is boring to death. Secondly, you have to be more or le competent about what you write. A prior research always help to write a powerful and effective assignment. But if you are sitting in a class and have to write on demand, you might find yourself at a complete loss. All you can think of is grinding word and making sentence to make that x-hundred of words. Same about a doctoral thesis in which you have stated your main arguments, have written 50 page and discovered that there are another 60 to go while you are running short on ideas. Luckily, you can resort to coursework writing service that will help you out. Another extreme is to write a concise article or a column limited to 500 or 700 word on a topic that you would like to cover in depth. You have so many excellent idea and arguments, one more brilliant than another. You see the problem from different angle and would like to dwell on various aspect but you only have those 700 words.

Does it make sense? Does it read well?” In the end you are struggling to compose a sentence not because of insufficient language skill or poor vocabulary but because you feel insecure and are afraid of a bad reaction to your piece of writing. You should not worry. No one wa born a a writer. Everybody can learn, and everyone can improve their writing skills. It just take practice. Do not be intimidated to write in your own manner.

Certainly, there is no secret to George Soros funding the most hated woman in Britain to stop Brexit. Can George Soros thwart Brexit? All the Remoaner MPs and other cohort of money obsessed traitor are given the impetus to act against Brexit, especially when they are handed brown envelope or suitcase full of money. The treachery of those in government who accept these payment to Remoan and thwart our democratic right to Brexit is something that is not only despicable but inherently immoral, and some would say illegal. In these time of treason, even if these money-grabbing coward get caught in the medium spotlight, a ha happened with the established Daily Telegraph reporting, they will still get away with murder. The reason being, the underlying establishment who are Remainers are supporting them. How much wrong ha to be committed on the people who voted for Brexit on June 23, 2016 until justice, and a bona fide exit from the EU is conducted? Leavers have been punished, denigrated and side-stepped for too long. Now is the time to fight back for democracy and to punish the crooks, scumbags and shit head who are actively trying destroy our democratic right to leave the EU whilst getting paid huge sum of money by their masters. Fuck you Soros and fuck you Gina Miller, and all the other crooked Remoaners on the take. You are vile, corrupt criminals.',\n",
       " 'http://www.epica-awards.com/ The Editors & Publishers International Creative Awards A busy Epica Awards London Showcase took place on the rooftop of production company GCRS in Great Marlborough Street on January 31. The event wa designed to give London audience a chance to enjoy the work awarded at Epica’s ceremony in Berlin in November. At the well-attended event, creatives Giles Hepworth and Bill Hartley of J. Walter Thompson London were congratulated for their award-winning entry “Ashes to Art”, which led to the agency becoming Epica’s UK agency of the year. Campaign Campaign’s global editor-in-chief, Claire Beale, who joined the Epica jury for the first time last year, praised the work. But she also encouraged more British agency to enter Epica in the future. “I saw so much inspiring work from other countries; I felt sort of humbled really. It wa a fantastic opportunity to appreciate the breadth of work from around the world. But I also thought: ‘Come on the Brits, where are you on this?’” J. Walter Thompson’s campaign involved encouraging artist to turn ash from a catastrophic fire at the Glasgow School of Art into original artwork. This wa then auctioned off to help pay for the school’s restoration. Bill Hartley remarked that the hardest part of the campaign wa convincing the artist themselves to take part. “In the end we resorted to good old-fashioned direct mail, sending them charred piece of wood in the post.” Creative Review Regular Epica juror Eliza Williams, associate editor of Creative Review, remarked that the award show had seen an increase in brand-purposed or charity work recently. She added: “The best thing for me is not only seeing the work, but getting the journalists’ impression of it…You get a perspective that perhaps you don’t get in any other setting.” Daily Squib First time attendee at the Epica soiree, Daily Squib editor, and champion of creativity, Aur Esenbel, wa truly impressed by the show of advertising and medium talent: “Meeting with Mark Tungate and other denizen of the advertising, publishing world wa inspiring. “It ha been a great honour to have been accepted a a juror for the creative Epica awards, and one ha to say that the essence of all creative work lie in intricate controlled chaotic exploration. “Defining that singular moment in the creative process when out of the ether, the creative pluck out an idea, an essence, a cherished spark that is then catapulted further with experimentation and work, to eventually create the final polished output, is not easily described. “Everyday, the Daily Squib work it creative juice whether in literature or illustration, and we are dedicated to the field of Creative Science in constructing our satire and news stories. “In line with Claire Beale, from Campaign magazine, the Epica Awards definitely need more British input. Hopefully in 2018, the award will see a bigger Brit emphasis. “Once again, thank you to the Epica team, and sponsor for holding such an event, and for inviting the Daily Squib to participate, it ha been a true honour.” Epica Awards Director – Mark Tungate Epica editorial director Mark Tungate extended a warm thanks to GCRS for hosting the evening for the second year running. He also thanked the other sponsors: Adobe, Euronews, Screen Vision and Global Production Network. Film CataCover, which provides weather insurance for shoots, sponsored the drinks. Tungate added: “The event wa a good-humoured a last year’s. Networking and socialising around a reel of outstanding creative work is a great way of shrugging off the gloom of January.”',\n",

Maybe this is revenge by the hacker and dark netters after their Bitcoin high wa spiked by various governments. It only make sense, if government want to hurt Crypto, the hacker and user on the dark net will fight back. Shit fly when the shit storm hits, and fear rise faster than it take a margin call to liquidate your positions. Sure, this could be a correction, hang in there, maybe even buy more, but what if it ain’t, you’ll be locked in a the stock hit the floor, your once tidy profit now a worthless piece of shit. Can you seriously watch the whole market drop while holding? No, siree! Better to dump, keep what cash you have. There’s also the Democrats, obviously they are enjoying this every moment with avid appreciation at the destruction of the Teflon Don, but what if the Dems engineered this fall? Well, they’ll hurt their people a much a others, although the hierarchy will only see that a collateral damage, and a necessary evil. Who frickin’ know what will happen now? The fall is contagious a much a fear is, and it spread like wildfire, it speed up, accelerates and burn every corner of the global financial markets. Some say we need to burn sometimes, but c’mon, it’s way better to ride the wave of a bull market than suffer the burn of a bear market.

       " 'A recently unveiled EU poster sport the oppressive Soviet hammer and sickle symbol numerous time T he EU is a Soviet construct utilising collectivist technique to strip former sovereign nation of their ability to construct their own laws, and dictating fiscal rule that rob former nation of making their own economic decisions. Ruled by an unelected core of technocrats, the EU Commission, they answer to no one, unlike a democracy where elected official answer to an electorate. Ask any European to name one single person who rule over them in the EU Commission, and you will get a blank answer. The sad part about this is that the regular EU citizen is not phased by this, instead they go on living their simple life without questioning anything. After the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, the Soviet official in the Eastern German communist government were integrated into the EU ruling hierarchy. Today we are seeing the fruit of their endeavours, with an EU so closely integrated that it is nigh on impossible for a nation to remove itself from the dictatorial structure. The UK may never leave the EU because of the various Marxist economic rule intertwined within it makeup. In the unlikely event that Britain doe manage to escape this Eurocommunist construct, one can only pity the nation left behind, who will have the rest of their sovereignty eviscerated and integrated into ‘Ever Closer Union’. To see the proud Gaelic Irish race, who fought tooth and nail to gain freedom from rule for thousand of years, join the EU without even a whimper, not even a fight is sad beyond belief. These proud fighter have condemned their nation and people to be ruled a slave by Brussels, where their every move is dictated, where their every law is ordered and where their every economic decision is instated without their say. To fight for thousand of years, then surrender your sovereignty without a single fight is a sign that there are defeated people amongst us, and the Irish are a lost race in the EU. Socialists, Marxists, and ill-informed actors, always cite Winston Churchill a wanting this communist sovietised EU construct, but they are wrong, Churchill hated communism, and to see a massive communist bloc emerge in Europe would have frightened his political sensibilities. His vision of a European future wa to see an Anglo-Franco union, but this never happened. Instead, we now have a Germano-Franco union ruling over the subsidiary countries. The Soviet style that the EU ha adopted is more of a Maoist modern Chinese communistic counterpart incorporating little utopian bit like the free-movement amongst all state Schengen Zone. EU communism can also be coined a the New Communism, or Eurocommunism. Economically speaking, the EU value capitalism, and yet is communist, much like China which embrace free market capitalism opposed to communist economics, yet is still a communist state. Mikhail Gorbachev once commented after the fall of the Berlin wall: “The most puzzling development in politics during the last decade is the apparent determination of Western European leader to re-create the Soviet Union in Western Europe.” Current Russian leader, Vladimir Putin ha said: “Above all, we should acknowledge that the collapse of the Soviet Union wa a major geopolitical disaster of the century. As for the Russian nation, it became a genuine drama. Tens of million of our co-citizens and co-patriots found themselves outside Russian territory. Moreover, the epidemic of disintegration infected Russia itself.” And from this disintegration of Old Soviet Russia came a New Soviet EUnion construct deep in the heart of Europe, called the European Union, and in the future, it will admit what it really is, ‘The Soviet European Union’. As for Russia, the plan probably highest in EU military circles, within the newly formed EU Army will be integration of Russia. From there, Putin and his crony will have their old Soviet state back, that is if they survive the purges. Modern communism within the EU is softened down version much like China, where religion is tolerated relatively, and there is heavy use of censorship to limit alternative viewpoint to it socialist ideologies. In essence, the EU want to spread a far a it can go. The planner deep in the EU Commission would like the EU to take over the world economically, much like they have conquered European nations, without a single shot being fired. What the EU is is the Fourth Reich backwards. Where Hitler began militarily to conquer Europe, the EU conquered Europe economically. Once this wa completed, this is when it wa safe to talk about creating an EU Army so a not create fear amongst it conquered subjects. The future of Europe is one that will be fraught with conflict thanks to the aspiration of the unelected leader of the EU who will invariably coax Russia into skirmish along the borders. It wa EU meddling in the Ukraine that finally awoke the sleeping bear, and Putin decided enough wa enough. There will be more of these incident occurring, until the Russian bear is mobilised completely, and the EU leader will have what they want, a full conventional ground war, and more of a reason for ever closer union.',\n",

It would take about one and a half year to complete. The sculptor have also compensated for the Don’s haircut, which would effectively make the statue 75 foot taller than the other statues, but we are sure that would be pleasing to the president. “Donald Trump’s head would go next to Abraham Lincoln’s, a there is a spot there ready for crafting. Altogether, the statue will cost the US taxpayer $42 million, that’s a drop in the ocean compared to what Donald Trump ha brought to America economically.”',\n",

To say it is dangerous to eat in Venice if you are a foreigner is an understatement. The unscrupulous restaurant owner love to rip off tourist who they think don’t know better. “The tourist he say to me he want a lasagne. I slap on a teaspoon of mincemeat, half cook, then throw on a piece of lettuce over the top. He smile like it best Italian food in world. I charge him 670 euro not including tax. He leaf happy, I leave restaurant straight to my mistress, happy. We all happy, innit?” another Venetian restauranter revealed with jocularity. It take fucking ball to charge someone that amount of money for a mediocre meal and get away with it. We asked an Italian psychologist what kind of person could get away with such behaviour? The ball of an Italian – Avercele “Balls! Avercele! Only an Italian can charge such large amounts. We have the biggest hairy ball in the world. As a man during the day, you have to touch your ball every few minutes, you know pat them, treat them nice. This is why Italian restaurant can charge obscene amount of money to tourist and get away with it, like nothing happened. Balls. That’s what Pacino said in Scarface, the only thing that give order is Balls. Women can’t do this shit, they don’t have the balls, and they don’t have Italian balls, the biggest fucking ball in the fucking world. That’s why we drive Ferraris and Lamborghini. That’s why we shoot for goal from halfway line, that’s why we can charge a Japanese tourist 750,000% over the normal asking price — Balls!” Professor of Psychology at Venice University, Gianluca Palle, revealed. The Venetian Tourist Board advised all visitor to Venice to be prepared to be ripped off at all restaurant a it is an “Italian customary right to inflict ridiculous price on tourists”. In November 2017, a British tourist dubbed a Venice restaurant “horrible and disgusting” after being charged €25,526 (£22,420) for lunch for three. The tourist from Coventry ate with his parent at Trattoria Stronzo in the central San Marco district, ordering a spread of food and sharing it between them. Italian restaurant often charge by weight rather than portion, and the restaurant denied any wrongdoing. Venice mayor Luigi Coglione introduced fine last year of 2,000 euro to dissuade tourist from littering, walking around topless and other act deemed inappropriate, but also said tourist “need to shell out a bit” when eating in the city, following criticism of extortionate bill at restaurants.',\n",
       " 'Hylas and the Nymphs by John William Waterhouse, 1896 When it come to the #metoo new puritanism that is sweeping the politically correct sovietized West, there is no place sacrosanct. Now that the art world and museum are being targeted worldwide by the cultureless puritan and their ISIS-like penchant for erasing history with destruction, new level of censorship and banning are being reached daily. “I saw a Roman statue of a female nymph. The statue objectifies the female form and accentuates her breast and privates. This is disgusting. We should ban everything Roman,” one social justice warrior yelled at the British museum’s Roman section. The woman wa then pointed towards the Greek section of the museum where she went even more hysterical after spying a sculpture of a Greek Goddess fellating a male lion according to some myth or something. Of course the sculpture of a nude woman objectifies the female form, that is what art is meant to do, it is meant to present this piece of stone, then transform it into this wonderful curvaceous objectification of the beautiful female form. It is in essence a celebration of the female. What the fuck is wrong with that? Sculptures and painter have been doing it for thousand of years. Celebration of Fertility Gustave Courbet’s 1866 painting “The Origin of the World” The vagina and vulva have been depicted in art from prehistory to the contemporary art era of the 21st century. Visual art form representing the female genitals encompass two-dimensional (e.g. paintings) and three-dimensional (e.g. statuettes). As long ago a 35,000 year ago, people sculpted Venus figurine that exaggerated the abdomen, hips, breasts, thighs, or vulva. Feminist activist Gina Warte, ha applauded an obscure Manchester art gallery — which will either hopefully be burned to the ground or attendance dropped to zero — that recently threw out a Waterhouse painting depicting some salacious nymph coaxing a man into a pond. This pre-Raphaelite masterpiece ha now been consigned to the bin thanks to the feminazi puritans. “This Waterhouse painting showed a vile depiction of young woman a object in a pond asking a man to join them. In 2018 wimmin hate men and we would never ask a man to join u in the water only if we could drown the bastard. I myself have never slept with a man or had relation with a man because I have big arms, a hairy chest and my vulva look like a pair of testicle dangling between my legs. I am therefore angry at men for rejecting me.” All gallery worldwide were warned in a global poster campaign funded by shady socialist group that they have until next week to remove all depiction of woman from all galleries, especially if nude. John D. Salinger, a gallery owner from New York wa not amused by the anti-art, anti-female form puritanical activism that ha been going around. “Puritans have a choice. They can stay away from the art gallery, they can switch off, they can hide in their room, but for fuck’s sake, let u other people enjoy what we’ve been enjoying for thousand of years, i.e. the female nude body. Just go and shoot yourself in your brainwashed nazi brain.”',\n",
       " 'W omen in film have not only had a hard time on the so-called ‘casting couch’ throughout history, but at the celebration of film, the yearly Oscars ceremony where sadly woman have suffered the sling and arrow of outrageous fortune, by being trumped on the podium by male actors/producers/directors. Betway Insider ha analysed the dire situation for woman at the Academy Awards. Out of 442 Oscar ceremonies, only five woman have ever been nominated for Best Director. This massive discrepancy can also be followed by the statistic that out of the five nominations, only one woman ha ever won an Oscar for directing, and that’s Kathryn Bigelow – ‘Hurt Locker’ at the 82nd Academy Awards in 2010. Greta Gerwig, wa nominated for ‘Lady Bird’ at the 2017 Academy Awards, the first since Kathryn Bigelow in 2010. The other female director nominated for Best Director were: Lina Wertmuller, ‘Seven Beauties’ (1977), Jane Campion, ‘The Piano’ (1994) and Sofia Coppola, ‘Lost in Translation’ (2004). In an industry dominated by men, the film industry ha to change it inherent bias, and address the multitude of female talent whether in acting or direction. Who would ever think that a film celebrating woman power like ‘Wonder Woman’ and actress Gal Gadot wa completely snubbed at the 2017 Academy Awards? This say it all. As for screenwriting, only 14 out of a possible 162 winner have been woman at the Academy Awards. It wa not until the 64th Academy Awards in 1992 that a solo female screenwriter wa honoured with an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, and that wa ‘Thelma and Louise’ writer, Callie Khouri. Three female screenwriter have won the award since then: Jane Campion, ‘The Piano’ (1994), Sofia Coppola, ‘Lost in Translation’ (2004) and Diablo Cody, ‘Juno’ (2008). Betway Insider Outlining the other category at the Academy Awards, a woman ha never won the Oscar for Best Cinematography, or even been nominated for the award until 2017 when Rachel Morrison wa nominated for ‘Mudbound’. The only category that ha produced the most female winner is Best Costume Design, with 58 of the possible 86 award going to women. So why is this happening? Women have a much talent behind and in front of the screen a men. Should woman not be treated equally in Hollywood with regard to their capacity for talent in important film roles? Well, the reason for this bias can only be found in the fact the Academy is a male-dominated industry. As of 2018, 72 percent of Oscar voter are men. Only two woman have ever hosted the Oscars solo: Whoopi Goldberg and Ellen DeGeneres, who have done so six time between them (1994, 1996, 1999, 2002, 2007 and 2014). In comparison, a man ha hosted the ceremony on his own 56 times. Will Hollywood, and the Academy Awards ever address this massive bias towards women, or will it always brush this subject under the red carpet a it always seems to do? Now is the time, in the millenium, to finally bring forth woman in the industry’s important roles, and to say goodbye to the old days, and old way of thinking.',\n",

The medic called it a priapism or something. We had to call for an ambulance.’ It remains unclear what article the man had been reading at the time. A video show the man’s friend and paramedic working together to move the man from a chair to a stretcher. The man is reportedly under hospital observation. Satire Addiction Satire addiction ha become a prominent societal issue among the young people in China, with an increasing number of young people choosing to ignore their studies, social life and family to surf the web for quality satire. Last October, a 21-year-old woman in China became blind in one eye after reading Daily Squib article on her mobile phone non-stop for six days. She wa thankfully cured after the doctor told her to read the Squib for a further six day with her remaining eye. Sadly she now cannot close her eyelid and ha a permanent stare dubbed the ‘1000 mile Squib stare’.',\n",
       " 'When the Conservative party is no longer conservative, when Britain is preferred to be a nation ruled by others with law governing the UK, why not go for Jeremy Corbyn a the next inhabitant of Number 10? In essence, the whole of the system ha gone to pot anyway, so let u reach out for more chaos, more disorder. Let u bite the bullet in ridiculousness, in utter monstrous change that ruin Britain further, because this nation ha already gone way below any viable meter, it ha in fact plumbed the depth of depravity that can never be fixed ever again. When we have member of the Conservative party openly deriding Britain, openly causing harm on the country and plotting it fall, and these people are applauded, they are not thrown headfirst from the Tory party, no, they are allowed to continue to create discord, to plot with Brussels, to receive payment from the nation’s enemy to hurt Britain and it interests. There is no hope in the Conservative party, and their stance on Brexit is the defining moment when the people who championed the Tories once should punish them dearly by voting and supporting Jeremy Corbyn to come to power and his high tax, unholy crusade to punish the rich, to punish the royals, and to punish the landed class with his antithesis to capitalism, and his Soviet Marxist ideal of collectivisation. Yes, the country would fall even further into debt, and multiple generation of Britons would be saddled with paying that off, but the Tories squandered their chance, especially with the unelection of Theresa May a PM. It is too late, it is too far gone to say anything else other than let u unite behind the communist shisters in Momentum and their champagne socialist Islington affair resplendent with the horrendous Marxist agenda brought upon by Comrade Corbyn. Let u support the grey bearded, red socked, sandalled one who shall step over the hallowed doorstep of Number 10, Downing Street, and defile the very corridors, and room that Margaret Thatcher once resided. The blood, crimson, bubbling with ardour and oozing from the blue stained Tories is one that ha come to be poured into a bucket, and tipped gently over the head of Theresa May. She had her chance, she squandered it. Now, she and the country will be punished forever by a Corbyn win — a pure hell that will envelope the nation like a dark tumultuous curtain of death. Not only will Labour condemn the nation to hell economically, but it will also turn around any EU Brexit wins, of which there are none, and soon we will all be embroiled in a euro currency, and forever servitude to the dastardly EU. No one had the ball to stand up to Theresa May. Not one single Tory stood up. Not one. This is why Jeremy Corbyn should be the correct punishment for the Tory apathy, and silence. And a Edmund Burke once said: “The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men should do nothing.”',\n",
       " 'Theresa May and her Remainer Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, and all the other Remainers who are in charge of the watered down Brexit are a key factor in Britain’s democracy dying a death so horrible that to look upon the UK a a democratic country with it own sovereign law ever again will be met only with sickening laughter. Such is the watering down process by the insipid May, who ha capitulated to every EU demand without even a word, that her contempt for the British people and their wish is all too evident. How Britain ha fallen from once a proud nation, sailing the high seas, conquering new lands, trading worldwide, exporting their wares, and importing other products. The death of Brexit ultimately mean the death of democracy, from whence the vulture and crooked scum traitor sold off their country for a pittance and aided our enemy against the Crown. The people of Britain are thus deemed worthless, they are mere chattel to be thrown from one place to another without say, democracy, a long forgotten memory amongst the dead eyed treasonous traitor who take backhander from Brussels and defend their immoral ill gotten gain by backstabbing the voter. Contempt for democracy, contempt for law, contempt for the will of the people, and contempt for Britain’s honour, only shame remains, shame and cowardice. The crooked have won, a Tony Blair laugh into the face of the British people, he gain more rich off their misery, and he laugh even more, the delight of getting away with treason, getting away with all that he ha done, the blood soaked membrane of dead Iraqi child moulded into each and every mansion he owns with his evil witch wife. Theresa May is a cowardly grey mutt, a withering faltering non-entity who ha succumbed to the EU, she ha sold the British nation to the dogs, condemned u to many more year of transitionary purgatory, just a her barren womb ache for a child, she herself ache for redemption from the people who she ha so callously betrayed. A stinking rotten womb black with injustice to the British people, Theresa May is a malevolent tawdry pus filled pustule that will one day burst onto her gilded mirror, a gooey reminder of what she really is, and how she cannot sleep at night any more. None of them who betrayed Britain should ever be allowed to forget their crime of treason, their abandonment of democracy and their treacherous selling of Britain to our enemy and their corpulent envelope filled with dirty euro handed to them under tables, in dark alleys, and EU offices. Betrayal of the fundamental tenet of democracy is what they have done by watering down Brexit. If one cannot hold a democratic referendum and have the result stick, what hope is there for democracy? We all know that the EU, a body of unelected official doe not value democracy, BUT BRITAIN SHOULD VALUE DEMOCRACY! You cannot have a referendum and then say it wa not the right answer you wanted then have another one, then another one until you get the correct answer according to your nefarious agenda? That IS NOT DEMOCRACY! The people were assured that the result of the EU Referendum, held on June 23, 2016, would stand. This result wa agreed to be respected by all parties, but they did not, and this is why we are here now in the year 2018, with a watered down Brexit in name only. We have had enough of Theresa May. She ha delayed, allowed Remainers to dictate what happens, and she ha agreed to all EU term without question. Theresa May is inoperative. There is no other way than to oust this fucking turkey, and put her in the oven. Get some fucking ball someone and get up, oust Theresa May right now. Decisions can be made in le than thirty seconds, do not think, ACT. You must do this right now, to save Britain from an un-democratic future under the EU. This is a fight for Western Democratic rights, it is a fight for our right to make our own laws, our own sovereign national state, it is a fight for the basic tenet of δημοκρατία dēmokratía, or “rule of the people” NOT by unelected faceless Eurocrat official from the European Commission. NO!',\n",
       " 'hansard.parliament.uk Somewhere under here is the answer to the problem we are dealing with today. Can you spot the elusive solution? The Prime Minister (Mrs. Margaret Thatcher) With permission, Mr. Speaker, I shall make a statement on the European Council held in Rome on 27 and 28 October, which I attended with my right hon. Friend Douglas Hurd the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary. The conclusion of the Council have been placed in the Library of the House. The Council had to deal in the first place with some urgent item of current business: namely, the Community’s failure to agree a negotiating position on agriculture for the Uruguay round of trade negotiations; the situation in the Gulf, and the position of the foreign national held hostage in Iraq and Kuwait; and the problem which have arisen in Hungary. Looking further ahead, the Council also dealt with the preparation for the two intergovernmental conferences, on economic and monetary union and also on institutional reform, which are due to begin in December. I shall report on the Council’s business in that order. The Uruguay round of trade negotiation is due to be completed before the end of this year. The outcome will decide whether world trade becomes steadily more open, or we repeat the mistake of the past and relapse into protectionism. The most difficult item is agriculture. All the major participant in the Uruguay round committed themselves to table negotiating offer by 15 October. All except the European Community have done so. The Community ha been discussing this problem since the round began in the autumn of 1986. It gave an unequivocal commitment in April last year to make substantial and progressive reduction in agricultural support. That commitment wa repeated at the Houston economic summit in July this year. The Commission ha put forward a proposal for 30 per cent. reductions, backdated to 1986. So what ha already been done by way of reduction of support since then will be set against that 30 per cent. There have been six session of European Community Ministers to discus the proposal. The most recent, lasting some 16 hours, wa on Friday last week. But no agreement ha been reached. The main opposition ha come from France and Germany. The Community’s failure ha harmed it reputation. Negotiations between the leading group of country cannot start until the Community’s proposal have been tabled. The European Council requested Ministers to meet again and put the Commission in a position to table a negotiating offer. The Netherlands Prime Minister suggested that the basis for this should be the position reached when Agriculture Ministers suspended their work early on 27 October. But President Mitterrand made it clear that France would continue to vote against those proposals. It remains for Agriculture and Trade Ministers to try yet again to reach a conclusion. If we fail, it will give a signal to the world that the Community is protectionist. Next, with regard to the Gulf and the position of the hostages, the European Council agreed a firm statement calling for Iraq’s withdrawal from Kuwait and confirming Europe’s absolute commitment to full implementation of the United Nations Security Council resolutions. The [column 870]statement make it clear that we shall consider further step if Iraq doe not comply. The message is that Saddam Hussein must not gain anything from his aggression. The Council also strongly condemned Iraq for holding foreign national a hostage and for using them in an unscrupulous way. This is totally unacceptable. Moreover, Iraq is negotiating over the hostage with the purpose of trying to divide the international community. After considerable discussion, the Council affirmed our determination not to send representative of our Governments in any capacity to negotiate with Iraq for the release of hostages, and to discourage others from doing so. I believe that the unity of the Twelve, and our determination not to allow Saddam Hussein to divide u on the question of hostages, will send a very powerful signal to Iraq. The third point is assistance to Hungary. In the course of the Council, member state received appeal from the Government of Hungary for help in dealing with the serious problem that have arisen a a result of the reduction in the supply of oil from the Soviet Union. The consequent price rise have given rise to unrest. The Council issued a strong statement of support for Hungary in pursuing it path towards democratic and economic reform and the rule of law. The Council also agreed, at the United Kingdom’s suggestion, to bring forward and disburse rapidly the second instalment of the $1 billion Community loan for Hungary which we agreed last year. This will be of direct practical assistance. Those were the urgent matter on which the Council had to act. Looking further to the future, we also discussed the preparation for the two intergovernmental conferences, or IGCs, which will start their work on 14 December. For the conference on political union, the Council had before it a report by Foreign Ministers listing a wide range of possible institutional change which the intergovernmental conference might consider. Heads of Government called for further work to be done on these proposal between now and December. My right hon. Friend Douglas Hurdthe Foreign Secretary and I argued that it would be wrong to prejudge the conclusion of the intergovernmental conference. We were on strong ground, since the Community’s original decision to call the conference specified that it should set it own agenda. Nevertheless, others wished to give specific direction to the IGC. We therefore reserved the United Kingdom’s position on, for example, extension of the Community’s power into new areas, greater power for the European Parliament in the legislative sphere, defining European citizenship, and a common foreign and security policy. All these are issue for discussion at the intergovernmental conference itself rather than to be settled in advance. On economic and monetary union, I stressed that we would be ready to move beyond the present position to the creation of a European monetary fund and a common Community currency which we have called a hard ecu. But we would not be prepared to agree to set a date for starting the next stage of economic and monetary union before there is any agreement on what that stage should comprise. And I again emphasised that we would not be prepared to have a single currency imposed upon us, nor to surrender the use of the pound sterling a our currency. The hard ecu would be a parallel currency, not a single currency. If, a time went by, people and Governments chose to use it widely, it could evolve towards a single [column 871]currency. But our national currency would remain unless a decision to abolish it were freely taken by future generation of Parliament and people. A single currency is not the policy of this Government. I should like to offer four comment in conclusion. First, the Community find it more difficult to take the urgent, detailed decision than to discus longer-term concepts. Moreover, no one should underestimate the extent to which national interest prevail among those who most proclaim their Community credentials. Secondly, Britain intends to be part of the further political, economic and monetary development of the European Community. That is what the great majority of member state want, too. When we come to negotiate on particular points, rather than concept or generalities, I believe that solution will be found which will enable the Community to go forward a Twelve. That will be our objective. Thirdly, we are fighting in Europe for British farmers, for British consumers, for a new world trade agreement, for help to the newly democratic country of eastern Europe, and for the interest and concern of our people. Fourthly, while we fully accept our commitment under the treaty and wish to co-operate more closely with other country in the European Community, we are determined to retain our fundamental ability to govern ourselves through Parliament. I believe that that is the wish of this House, and we on this side will do our best to see that it is fulfilled. Mr. Neil Kinnock (Islwyn) I thank the right hon. Lady for that statement and welcome the summit statement on, first, the complete solidarity of the Governments of the Community country against Saddam Hussein and, secondly, economic support for the Soviet Union, Hungary and other central and east European countries. On the central matter discussed in Rome, is it not clear that last weekend the Prime Minister managed to unite the rest of the European Community against her, to divide her own party and, more importantly, further to weaken the influence that Britain need in order properly to uphold our national interest in the European Community? Can the Prime Minister tell u why she wa apparently taken by surprise by the proposal put by others in Rome? Does she not recall that in 1985 she whipped and guillotined the Single European Act through the House, in June 1989 at Madrid she formally agreed with other head of Government to be determined to achieve the progressive realisation of economic and monetary union, and at the Dublin summit this year she agreed to intensify the process of European union in economic, monetary and political terms? Those were all step which raised comment at the time. Did she not know what she wa doing on those occasions, or wa she living in cloud cuckoo land? The Prime Minister say that the Government would not surrender the use of the pound sterling a our currency. Perhaps she will therefore tell u how she regard the advice of her fellow Conservative, Commissioner Brittan, when he said: “YOU DON’T HAVE TO LOSE THE POUND STERLING UNDER THE SINGLE CURRENCY PLAN. YOU CAN PERFECTLY WELL HAVE A NOTE OR A COIN WHICH STATES ITS VALUE IN POUNDS … AND ITS FIXED EQUIVALENT IN ECU … IT’S BEEN AGREED THAT THAT WOULD BE POSSIBLE.” On the connection between currency and sovereignty, can the Prime Minister, who abandoned her own Madrid condition before she put sterling into the exchange rate mechanism, tell the House what will be her condition now [column 872]for putting sterling into the narrow banding of the ERM? The Prime Minister could come to a debate and explain all these thing from the Dispatch Box if she wa willing to do so. When the Prime Minister conduct herself a she did in Rome this weekend, is it any wonder that she cannot even get agreement for the necessary reduction in farm subsidies? [Interruption.] She ha no influence at all. When she conduct herself a she does, is it any wonder that some member of her own party believe that she ha undermined the Chancellor’s effort to build support for the so-called hard ecu? Does she not realise that such an attitude make the Heads of other Governments even le susceptible to listening to the sensible argument that can be deployed in favour of sovereignty in the Community? Does she accept that it is reasonable to put the view that the determinant of the pace and direction of economic and monetary union should be the reality of economic performance and the degree of economic convergence, not arbitrary diary dates? Does the Prime Minister not understand that, with her method of conducting affairs, she is throwing away that sound argument and losing both potential ally and necessary influence? Does she not appreciate that, even now, her tantrum tactic will not stop the process of change or change anything in the process of change? All they do is strand Britain in a European second division without the influence over change that we need, the financial and industrial opportunity that we need and the sovereignty that we need. The Prime Minister It is our purpose to retain the power and influence of this House, rather than denude it of many of it powers. I wonder what the right hon. Gentleman’s policy is, in view of some of the thing that he said. Would he have agreed to a commitment to extend the Community’s power to other supplementary sector of economic integration without having any definition of what they are? One would have thought, from what he said, that he would. The Commission want to extend it power and competence into health matters, but we said no, we would not agree to that. From what the right hon. Gentleman said, it sounded a though he would agree, for the sake of agreeing, and for being Little Sir Echo, and saying, “Me, too.” Would the right hon. Gentleman have agreed to extending qualified majority voting within the Council, to delegating implementing power to the Commission, to a common security policy, all without any attempt to define or limit them? The answer is yes. He doe not have a clue about the definition of some of the thing that he is saying, let alone securing a definition of others. We have agreed to wait to give support to the Soviet Union until the IMF report is received. That is coming at the next summit. It wa not we who stopped unity on agriculture—it wa France and Germany. Had the right hon. Gentleman even read the statement, which he had before I came in, he would have noticed—and had he even listened to the statement when I made it, he would have known—that it wa Francois Mitterrand who said that he would not agree to the Commission’s proposal. We are not to blame in any way for not reaching agreement on agriculture. But for the insistence of my right hon. Friend Douglas Hurdthe Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and me, the chair would not even have had the matter discussed, so urgent wa it that [column 873]it should be. I told the chair over a week ago that, if the farm Ministers did not reach agreement, we must discus the matter, and I wrote to him. He did everything that he could to see that a matter so urgent wa not discussed, but we succeeded in getting it discussed. As to the right hon. Gentleman’s stricture about economic and monetary union, that phrase wa agreed by the European Community before we went in. It is one of those thing that we inherited. It wa agreed in 1972. When it came to defining it—[Interruption.] We went into the Community in 1973, and I had understood that most Labour Members were in favour of that. I wonder today if they are changing their stance for the sake of debating points. Leon Brittan is a loyal member of the Commission. Yes, the Commission want to increase it powers. Yes, it is a non-elected body and I do not want the Commission to increase it power at the expense of the House, so of course we differ. The President of the Commission, Mr. Delors, said at a press conference the other day that he wanted the European Parliament to be the democratic body of the Community, he wanted the Commission to be the Executive and he wanted the Council of Ministers to be the Senate. No. No. No. Perhaps the Labour party would give all those thing up easily. Perhaps it would agree to a single currency and abolition of the pound sterling. Perhaps, being totally incompetent in monetary matters, it would be only too delighted to hand over full responsibility to a central bank, a it did to the IMF. The fact is that the Labour party ha no competence on money and no competence on the economy—so, yes, the right hon. Gentleman would be glad to hand it all over. What is the point of trying to get elected to Parliament only to hand over sterling and the power of this House to Europe? Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman will understand his brief a little better next time. Mr. Nicholas Ridley (Cirencester and Tewkesbury) rose—— Hon. Members Speak for Germany. Mr. Speaker Order. Mr. Ridley Mr. Ridley May I congratulate my right hon. Friend on standing up for the interest of the people of this country and ask her whether she think that the eleven are not now both isolated and intransigent in relation to agricultural policy and the GATT round? Does she think that they are deliberately working for the failure of the GATT round in order to achieve their objective of a fortress Europe? If they are, doe she agree that that is not a destination for which we want to board the train? The Prime Minister My right hon. Friend is right. The European community is the only group of nation which, after year of studying the problem, ha not tabled an initial negotiating position on agriculture in the GATT round. The United States, Japan, the Cairns group, Canada and Switzerland have tabled theirs, but from the Community—nothing. It really is a disgrace that we have not even been able to agree on a negotiating position, let alone start to negotiate with all the other group by between now and the end of the year. [column 874] Yes, I agree with my right hon. Friend that several country in the Community are highly protectionist. The common agricultural policy is a protectionist policy, but we will try to reduce the protectionism, first because it would help the third world, secondly because it would mean that we would not have export subsidies—and thereby take business away from other countries—and thirdly because in this country we believe in open trade. This wa the most serious matter to be discussed at the European Council, and I most earnestly hope that this time Agriculture Ministers—there will be no difficulty with us, but I mean the French and German Agriculture Ministers—will accept the proposal of the Commission for the negotiating position in the Uruguay round. Mr. Paddy Ashdown (Yeovil) Does the Prime Minister realise how welcome it wa to hear in her statement that she ha at last been forced to admit that the hard ecu proposal can be a transitional mechanism to a single currency? Will she congratulate the Chancellor and the Foreign Secretary on levering her forward towards reality on that matter? Does she realise that that is good news for Britain? Does the right hon. Lady realise how much of her performance at Rome wa bad news for Britain? Does she realise that in a single meeting she ha isolated this country in Europe, weakened our voice in Europe, divided the Government and betrayed this country’s long-term best interests? Does she realise that if she faced a Labour party that wa not equally divided, muddled and confused on this matter, she would today face a motion of no confidence in her failure at this historic moment? Does she realise—[Interruption.] Mr. Speaker Order. Mr. Ashdown Does the Prime Minister realise that for a long a she hang on to power, so long will Britain be held back from it future, and that she no longer speaks for Britain—she speaks for the past? The Prime Minister Oh dear, it seems that there must be quite a lot of late parrot in cloud cuckoo land, judging by the right hon. Gentleman coming out with that stuff. Of course, if there is a parallel currency and people choose to make more and more use of it, it could evolve into a single currency, but that could not be done without a decision coming back to this House and, I believe, to the people of this country. I take it that the right hon. Gentleman’s policy is to abolish the pound sterling, the greatest expression of sovereignty. In any event, it would be totally and utterly wrong to agree to that now. That matter is one to be decided by future generation and future Parliaments. Parliament is supreme, not the right hon. Gentleman the Leader of the Liberal Democrats. Mr. Robin Squire (Hornchurch) In the light of last weekend’s discussions, will my right hon. Friend reconsider in the near future the proposal to separate the Bank of England and make it independent so that it may serve a a buttress in this country’s battle against inflation? The Prime Minister Independent bank are mostly either answerable to a parliament—as in the United States, where Mr. Greenspan is answerable to Congress—or have a number of politician on their boards. I do not believe that the structure that this country currently ha would be [column 875]served well by the proposal that my hon. Friend mentions. It is far better to increase democracy than to reduce it, which I believe would be wrong at this time. Mr. James Lamond (Oldham, Central and Royton) What is the point of the Prime Minister trying to wrap herself in the union jack for electoral purposes—[Hon Members: “Better that than the red flag.” ]—and then coming to the Dispatch Box to tell the House that she is prepared to sell the working people of this country down the river by opening Britain up completely to free trade without any protectionism whatsoever, destroy the multi-fibre arrangement, and give the emerging democracy in Europe £1,000 million in loan to produce good on wage of £80 a month, so that textile in particular will flood into this country, which would destroy hundred of thousand of British jobs? Is that what the right hon. Lady wa elected to do? Is she really protecting this country, or is she only pretending to do so? The Prime Minister The hon. Gentleman probably heard the comment made by some of my right hon. and hon. Friends, “Better to wrap yourself in the union jack than the red flag.” The hon. Gentleman’s remark amount to a totally protectionist policy, which would lead to retaliation against us, reduce the capability of our export industry and therefore our standard of living, and make our industry inefficient and therefore cost the housewife a great deal more. I note also that the hon. Gentleman complains about good entering Britain from Third world country where wage are far lower. I have heard the hon. Gentleman say several time in the House that Third world country need help. They need trade a much a they need aid. Mr. Norman Tebbit (Chingford) Does my right hon. Friend agree that the mark of a single currency is not only that all other currency must be extinguished but that the capacity of other institution to issue currency must also be extinguished? In the case of the United Kingdom, that would involve Parliament binding it successor in a way that it ha hitherto regarded a unconstitutional. The Prime Minister I am grateful to my right hon. Friend. This Government have no intention of abolishing the pound sterling. If the hard ecu were to evolve and much greater use were to be made of it, that would be a decision for future Parliaments and generations. That decision could be taken only once. It should not be taken in the current atmosphere, but only after the greatest possible consideration. I believe that both Parliament and sterling have served this country and the rest of the world very well. We are more stable and influential with sterling, and it is an expression of our sovereignty. This Government believe in the pound sterling. Mr. James Molyneaux (Lagan Valley) Does the Prime Minister recall that Britain wa in a minority of one in the Europe of 1940? Does she further agree that, 50 year on, the basic issue is still the same—undiluted parliamentary democracy and not imposed diktat? The Prime Minister I totally agree with the right hon. Gentleman. There are some thing for which there wa majority voting within the Community when we went in, and we accepted that, and for the specific objective of achieving the Single European Act only, there have been [column 876]more matters. Now there is an attempt to get far more thing passed by majority voting. That mean that we would have more law imposed upon us, even if the House wa flatly against them. We expect our people to obey the law, mainly because it ha gone through all the legislative process in this House, and we should be very slow to add to any majority competence on the part of the Community. Mr. Steve Norris (Epping Forest) Does my right hon. Friend accept that there is wide support in my constituency for the stance that she took at the intergovernmental conference on economic and monetary union? Does she further accept that that support is based not on the nicety of international economics but on the clear and firm belief that those who dictate fiscal policy to the United Kingdom should be fully and directly answerable to it electors? The Prime Minister I totally agree with my hon. Friend. The Delors report is proposing that those people should be answerable to no one. It is very ironic indeed that, at a time when eastern Europe is striving for greater democracy, the Commission should be striving to extinguish democracy and to put more and more power into it own hands, or into the hand of non-elected bodies. Ms. Joyce Quin (Gateshead, East) Is it not true that the British Government are far more reluctant than Germany, France or Italy to give economic assistance to the Soviet Union? Is the Prime Minister not aware of the political risk within the Soviet Union if we do not respond generously at this time, and of the long-term risk for British industry if other country step in and establish aid and trading relationship with the Soviet Union before we do? The Prime Minister The German banks—the Deutsche bank—made a considerable loan to the Soviet Union of some DM6 billion. That had all gone within a matter of weeks. It wa guaranteed by the Government of the Federal Republic, and it wa all gone in a matter of weeks—used to repay debt which the Soviet Union owed to German manufacturers. That ha done nothing to help the economic situation in the Soviet Union. When we got the request for help, we suggested that we should not consider general loan which would not help a country that wa already in difficulties, but should see if we could give specific help in certain spheres—for example food processing, transport and oil exploration. We are studying that, and the International Monetary Fund is judging what it is necessary for the Soviet economy to do to get it out of it present difficulties. Fortunately, between the Houston economic summit and now, the Soviet Union ha had a windfall in the sense that the increasing price of oil ha given it a much better balance of payment position on a much greater scale than here, so that ha improved it position. We shall make up our mind when the IMF ha reported. Mr. Cranley Onslow (Woking) If these partner of ours—France and Germany—persist in blocking the reform of the common agricultural policy in December, what useful purpose doe my right hon. Friend think that the intergovernmental conference is likely to achieve? The Prime Minister My right hon. Friend put his finger on it absolutely. Agriculture and trade are two [column 877]subjects in which, a national countries, we have no competence at all a it is all negotiated through the Community. They can therefore do that—they can even do it in the Agriculture Council—by majority voting. If France and Germany stick together and refuse to have reduction in their subsidies, many of the other country where farmer are far poorer than those in France and Germany will say, “How in the world can we agree to lower subsidy when the Community’s two set of richest farmer will not do so?” I hope that the compromise solution that the Commission hammered out with Agriculture Ministers will nevertheless go through, but that is only the start, not the end, of the negotiating position with other countries; otherwise, we shall be responsible for reducing world trade. Dr. David Owen (Plymouth, Devonport) Is it not perfectly clear that what wa being attempted at Rome wa a bounce which led only one way—to a single federal united state of Europe? Is it not vital that, in this House and across party lines, it should be possible for a Prime Minister to make it clear, if necessary, that Britain is prepared to stand alone? We should not relish it, but if we were faced with the imposition by treaty of a single currency and with a situation that prevented the enlargement of the Community to include Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia, would not Britain be entitled and right to use the veto? The Prime Minister I totally agree with the right hon. Gentleman. That is precisely the stance that we took. It is the stance that we have taken on many previous occasions. The European monetary system to which we belong is designed for 12 sovereign states, in co-operation with one another, to come to an exchange rate mechanism. What is being proposed now—economic and monetary union—is the back door to a federal Europe, which we totally and utterly reject. We prefer greater economic and monetary co-operation, which can be achieved by keeping our sovereignty. Mr. Hugh Dykes (Harrow, East) Does my right hon. Friend agree and confirm that her word today mean in effect that she would prefer to withdraw from the treaty of Rome and the Single European Act? The Prime Minister No. We should like to have the kind of Europe that we believe in and the Europe that we went in to join. If my hon. Friend look back at some of the speeches, he will see that we were absolutely assured that we should not be giving up sovereignty. That wa the basis upon which we went in. On 24 May 1971 Edward Heaththe Prime Minister said: “WE AGREED IN PARTICULAR THAT THE IDENTITY OF NATIONAL STATES SHOULD BE MAINTAINED IN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE DEVELOPING COMMUNITY. THIS MEANS, OF COURSE, THAT, THOUGH THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION HAS MADE AND WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE A VALUABLE CONTRIBUTION, THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE THE FORUM IN WHICH IMPORTANT DECISIONS ARE TAKEN, … IT PROVIDES A CLEAR ASSURANCE, … THAT JOINING THE COMMUNITY DOES NOT ENTAIL A LOSS OF NATIONAL IDENTITY OR AN EROSION OF ESSENTIAL NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY.” —[OFFICIAL REPORT, 24 MAY 1971; VOL. 818, C. 32–33.] Mr. Nigel Spearing (Newham, South) Despite what the Prime Minister ha just said, is it not clear that it is the [column 878]wish of our partner that there should be a loss of national identity on currency? Is it not true that even the hard ecu, coupled with fixed exchange rates, would lead inexorably to economic and monetary union and to government either of banker for banker by banker or to a strong political central government that would usher in a new Euro-state? If the Prime Minister is to save Britain a a self-governing nation, had she not better make that clear and galvanise the people of this country and all party in Parliament to say a very polite no to economic and monetary union? The Prime Minister If I believed that, I would do just a the hon. Gentleman says, but I do not believe that his interpretation is correct. I accept that many in the Economic Community would like to have their version of economic and monetary union, which would lead to passing power away from national Parliaments to a non-elected body—in fact, to a central board of bankers—to majority voting and to the giving of more legislative power to the European Parliament. That is their version, but it is not the version that we have accepted. The Single European Act defined economic and monetary union a “Co-operation in Economic and Monetary policy” . That is all you need, in my view. The hard ecu is a proposal that doe not require a central bank, which would make it an inflation-proof currency and which could be used if people chose to do so. In my view, it would not become widely used throughout the Community—[Interruption.]—possibly most widely used for commercial transactions. Many people would continue to prefer their own currency. Therefore, I do not believe that the fear of the hon. Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing) will happen. I am pretty certain that most people in this country would prefer to continue to use sterling. If, by their choice, I wa wrong, there would come a time when we would have to address the question. However, that would not be for u but for future generation in the House. Mr. Terence Higgins (Worthing) Will my right hon. Friend take time between now and the conference in December to explain to her European colleague what any first-year economic student could tell them, which is that the imposition of a single currency, a opposed to a common currency, would rule out for all time the most effective mean of adjusting for national difference in cost and prices? Will she explain that that in turn would cause widespread unemployment, which would probably exist on a perpetual basis, and very serious financial imbalances? The Prime Minister Yes, I agree entirely with my right hon. Friend. It would do just that. It would also mean that there would have to be enormous transfer of money from one country to another. It would cost u a great deal of money. One reason why some of the poorer country want it is that they would get those big transfer of money. We are trying to contest that. If we have a single currency or a locked currency, the difference come out substantially in unemployment or vast movement of people from one country to another. Many people who talk about a single currency have never considered it full implications. Mr. Jim Sillars (Glasgow, Govan) Will the Prime Minister ignore the advice of the right hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Dr. Owen), who talked about the British state standing alone? Will she bear in mind her humiliating experience when she wa forced into the ERM [column 879]against all her instinct and her declaration in Madrid? Is the Prime Minister aware that many people in Europe, not only in the United Kingdom, are aware of the formidable economic, political and social problem inherent in stage 2 and moving to a single currency? Does she not think that she would have a far better chance of getting people to talk about a sensible and cautious approach if, in addressing her colleague in Europe, she used the moderate language of a 21st-century European and not the intemperate language of a little Englander? The Prime Minister Bearing in mind that the hon. Gentleman wa not there, will he tell me of any language that wa intemperate? Those who seem to know most about this are the people who were not there and heard nothing of what wa said or of the way in which it wa done. Radio and television broadcast are outside and after the finish of the conference. We have always said that we would join the exchange rate mechanism when the time wa right. That wa part of our going into the European monetary system, to which we have belonged for many years. We have put some of our reserve with the European monetary system and have the usual swap arrangement that that entails. The completion of the European monetary system is the exchange rate mechanism. All that can be done by nation state co-operating with one another. We do not need to have a federal structure at all. The time came when most of the other country had abolished their foreign exchange control and we had led them, way ahead. Yes, I think that it wa we and Germany who were isolated in that we got rid of foreign exchange control first. The others followed, but Spain still ha not done so. When they had done that, and when we adjudged that the time wa right—I think that every figure that ha come out since ha indicated that we were right in our timing of joining the ERM and in reducing the interest rate—we completed our obligation to join. That doe not mean that we agree with the next stage, which is a totally different definition of economic and monetary union. Mr. Anthony Nelson (Chichester) Does my right hon. Friend agree that the prospect for the British people enjoying a higher standard of living and sharing in greater prosperity will depend in no small part on securing a currency that is strong and stable—something that ha dogged u in the post-war years? Is that not more likely to be achieved if we have a common currency based on the great economy of Western Europe rather than relying on our going it alone? The Prime Minister No, I think that many of my colleague in Europe—in our European Council and certainly in the Finance Council—will say that there is no way in which there can be a single currency until all economy are at the same state of development, the same state of prosperity and in a Europe with one economy right across it. I do not think that there is any possibility of that stage being reached for a very long time. To take a single currency long before that ha happened would be to weaken it and not to strengthen it. We will have a stronger sterling, with all it history. Many security and contract are denominated in sterling. We shall trade better with the great history behind sterling than we possibly could with a single currency. [column 880] Mr. Ron Leighton (Newham, North-East) There is no majority in the House for EMU, but is the Prime Minister aware that I attended a conference in Italy last year at which an Italian Minister spoke to me about EMU? I said, “What if Mrs. Thatcher opposes it?” Ungallantly, he laughed out loud and said, “We have met Mrs. Thatcher many times—she squawk and make a noise at the beginning but always come round and give way in the end.” What assurance and guarantee can the Prime Minister give the House that she will not give way on this issue, a she gave way on the Madrid condition about British inflation before joining the ERM? The Prime Minister That is what they said when I wa negotiating for a better budget deal for Britain. Twice, the people in the Commission—our people in the Commission and the presidency of the Commission—advised me to give way. They found out differently. Mr. Paul Channon (Southend, West) Does my right hon. Friend agree—— Hon. Members We cannot hear. Mr. Speaker Order. Hon. Members are not alone in that. Mr. Channon Does my right hon. Friend agree that there is a grave risk that unless the Community can get it negotiating position together the GATT round of talk may collapse in the next few months? If that happens, it would be no dry, academic exercise but would mean higher cost for consumer in many country in the next few years. Does my right hon. Friend agree that the Community’s compromise proposal on agriculture, which have been rejected, are ludicrously modest? Will she urge our colleague in the Community to try to reach a solution—if not now, at least during the next IGC? The Prime Minister I agree with my right hon. Friend. If we do not reach a solution in Geneva in the Uruguay round, it will mean retaliation against us, and people’s worst fears—that the Economic Community is nothing but a fortress Europe and a protectionist club—will be realised. If we did not get a result on the agriculture round, it would not be our fault but the fault of France and Germany. There are certain protectionist element in France, a my right hon. Friend knows. Even when we get our own negotiating position, a I hope that we shall within a week, I hope that it will be on the basis that we have been negotiating for six previous meetings. We still have to have negotiation on the other proposal that we put up with all the countries. There is still a tough way to go before we get a conclusion, but the important thing—important for the welfare of all our people—is that that round meet with success. Mr. Jack Ashley (Stoke-on-Trent, South) A single European currency mean loss of control over our monetary policy. Our monetary policy ha been an absolute shambles, so what is the Prime Minister fussing about? The Prime Minister Monetary policy wa in it greatest shamble under Labour, when inflation reached 27 per cent. Sir Richard Body (Holland with Boston) Will my right hon. Friend make it clear that, if the procrastination about export subsidy by the European Community on surplus [column 881]food continues, with the result that the Uruguay round collapse and the United States then resort to a protectionist policy in self-defence, the one country in the EC that will suffer will be the United Kingdom? The Prime Minister As my hon. Friend knows, we always try for open trading. We also try to defend our farmer to see that they get a fair deal because, mostly, the subsidy in Europe go to the smaller farmers. By subsidising the smaller farmers, the efficiency of the larger family farm is undercut. We will do everything that we can to ensure that the picture that my hon. Friend ha painted doe not come about. Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones(Ynys Môn) Does the Prime Minister agree that her isolation at the Rome summit will seriously damage Wales’s prospect of benefiting under the single market, and from the export and investment opportunity that will arise? Does she also agree that Wales, which is on the periphery of Europe, need to be at the heart of the decision-making process in Europe and that a positive approach to Europe is needed? Does not her isolationist stance prove that Wales need direct representation in the Community institutions? The Prime Minister The hon. Gentleman’s stricture would have been better directed to France and Germany, which have taken an isolationist stance on agricultural subsidy for three years. It would have been very much better if they had come along with the rest instead of sticking out for their own farmer against the good of the EC a a whole. It wa those country which were isolated on that most urgent matter. As for investment, Wales—like the rest of the United Kingdom—has benefited enormously from the economic policy of this Government. We have brought in ton and ton of investment from overseas to Wales, to Scotland and to the north of England, greatly to the benefit of job here. People have great confidence in this Government, which is why they invest in Britain. What a pity the hon. Gentleman cannot speak up a little more for his own country. Mr. Tony Favell (Stockport) Next Wednesday, the door of this Chamber will be closed to Black Rod a a symbol of the independence of this House. What would be the effect on the independence of this House and on the nation that elect it if the power to veto proposal affecting social affairs, the environment and taxation were to be removed? The Prime Minister I hope that, when the next election comes, people who want to come to the House will come to uphold it power and it responsibilities, and not to denude the House of them. We have surrendered some of them to the Community, and in my view we have surrendered enough. Mr. Tony Benn (Chesterfield) Is the Prime Minister aware that what we are really discussing is not economic management, but the whole future of relation between this country and Europe? This issue is not best expressed in 19th-century patriotic language or in emotive language about which design is on the currency. The real question is whether, when the British people vote in a general election, they will be able to change the policy of the [column 882]previous Government. It is already a fact, a the House know full well, that whatever Government are in power, our agricultural policy is controlled from Brussels, our trade policy is controlled from Brussels and our industrial policy is controlled from Brussels. If we go into EMU, our financial policy will also be controlled. It is a democratic argument, not a nationalistic argument. However, given that the right hon. Lady is a member of the Government who took u into the European Community without consulting the British people, given that she wa Prime Minister in the Government who agreed to the Single European Act without consulting the British people, and given that she ha now agreed to joining the exchange rate mechanism without consulting the British people, we find it hard to believe that she is really intent on preserving democracy rather than gaining political advantage by waving some national argument around on the eve of a general election. That is why we do not trust her judgment on the matter. The Prime Minister I think that I would put it just a little differently from the right hon. Gentleman, although I recognise some of the force of some of the point that he makes. When the Delors proposal for economic and monetary union came out, it wa said immediately by my right hon. Friend Nigel Lawson the then Chancellor of the Exchequer that this wa not really about monetary policy at all but about a back door to a federal Europe, taking many democratic power away from democratically elected body and giving them to non-elected bodies. I believe fervently that that is true, which is why I shall have nothing to do with their definition of economic and monetary union. We shall continue the co-operation that we have come to establish, a nation states. The Act that enabled u to go into Europe wa passed on Second Reading by eight vote and it wa made very clear then that we would not surrender our national identity, that it wa a matter of co-operation. It wa on the strength of that that many people went in. I am afraid that it would be quite different if we went for a single European currency and a central bank and for their definition of economic and monetary union. Mr. Churchill (Davyhulme) Will my right hon. Friend tell the House how far she belief that, when the moment comes, Germany will be prepared to see the transfer of it monetary policy from the Bundesbank to a European central bank on which it will have one voice out of 12? The Prime Minister I think that it is wrong to think that all the Twelve have similar vote or influence in these matters. I think that some in Germany—only some—are backing the scheme because they know that the dominant voice, the predominant voice, on any central bank would be the German voice. If we did not retain our national identity in Europe, the dominant people in Europe would be German. The way to balance out the different view of Europe, a we have traditionally done throughout history, is by retaining our national identity. Mr. Andrew Faulds (Warley, East) In view of the imminent death of thousand of young men—Arab, European and American—would it not be more compassionate and realistic of the Prime Minister to abandon her adamant refusal even to contemplate a negotiated solution to the Gulf crisis? [column 883] The Prime Minister I have not noticed much compassion about Saddam Hussein in Kuwait, about the way in which our hostages, our embassy or the national in Kuwait have been treated. There is nothing to negotiate about. Mr. Faulds There is everything to negotiate about, you stupid woman—— Mr. Speaker Order. Mr. Faulds You stupid, negative woman. The Prime Minister I seem to smell the stench of appeasement in the air—the rather nauseating stench of appeasement. The United Nations ha clearly said that Iraq must come out of Kuwait—— Mr. Faulds Have your war. You would love a war. You love war. Mr. Speaker Order. That is very bad behaviour from the hon. Gentleman. He ha asked a question and he is getting the answer. He may not like it, but he must not shout in that way. The Prime Minister Saddam Hussein started a war, and it continues day after day with the killing, murder, torture and brutal treatment of people. Some people—and most Members of the House—have the gut to stand up to him. Mr. Geoffrey Dickens (Littleborough and Saddleworth) Prime Minister, may I ask you why you have been so modest this afternoon? In the past, have you not stood alone on European matter and been proved right? I am thinking of United Kingdom contributions, of the reform of the common agricultural policy, of mortgage cartel and of exchange controls. Each time, Prime Minister, you have been right. Why should the House not trust you today? The Prime Minister May I thank my knight in shining armour? I could not have put it better myself. Mr. Dave Nellist (Coventry, South-East) When preparing the statement on the Gulf that the Prime Minister ha said wa agreed in Rome, wa the right hon. Lady aware of the existence of publicly available estimate by American chief of staff that within 12 day of combat there would be 30,000 allied casualties, and that 10,000 of them would be fatalities? If she disagrees with the American estimates, can she tell u what estimate have been made by the British chief of staff? The Prime Minister I remember when this country had to send force down to the Falklands. Chiefs of staff were frequently asked what were their estimate of casualties. No one can make such an estimate. Mr. Nellist The Americans have. The Prime Minister No one can make such an estimate. There are people who can guess, but those guess have turned out before to be very wide of the mark. It is not a question that I ask, because I know the impossibility of answering it. Mr. Jonathan Aitken (Thanet, South) May I congratulate my right hon. Friend on the valiant stand that she ha been taking to fight for Britain’s economic and [column 884]parliamentary independence in Europe? Will she emphasise that standing apart from the eleven’s plan for European monetary union may bring positive economic benefit to Britain? Does she agree that the country with the strongest currency, one of the highest per caput income and one of the strongest financial service industry in Europe, is economically and politically independent Switzerland? Does she also agree, therefore, that economic independence is no barrier to economic success? The Prime Minister I entirely agree. Switzerland ha a marvellous record on currency, manufacturing and services, and we too shall continue to do so if others go for a single currency and we stay outside. Mr. Giles Radice (Durham, North) The right hon. Lady ha referred to the 11 other European leader a living in cloud cuckoo land. Has it not occurred to her that she may be living in cloud cuckoo land if she think that the majority of the British people are likely to go along with her short-sighted proposal on economic and monetary union, which are likely to lead to Britain’s being excluded from Europe’s first division? The Prime Minister No, I think that that is totally wrong. I note that the hon. Gentleman belief in a single currency regardless of the many consequence that it would have for this country—regardless of how much we would have to transfer, and regardless of the enormous consequence for our securities. I do not believe that his view is shared by many of the people. Mr. Radice We shall see. The Prime Minister Indeed we shall, but I think that the hon. Gentleman will find that most people prefer to have the pound sterling and our Parliament. If he doe not wish to have either, why doe he want to come here after the next election? Mr. Jacques Arnold (Gravesham) Will my right hon. Friend continue to bear in mind that the success of the Uruguay round and the GATT is vital to the economy of the new democracy in Latin America and the third world? Does she not agree that fine word in Rome butter no tortillas? The Prime Minister I agree. We can always talk about the generalities. When it came to getting down to a detailed negotiation, they did not even want to address the subject there. They ran away from it. They then said that they should set a stage 2 without having decided on it contents. We do not know what we are going to do in stage 2 yet, but they have set a date for it. That is very different from what Delors said in his report, when he stated clearly: “THE CONDITIONS FOR MOVING FROM STAGE TO STAGE CANNOT BE DEFINED PRECISELY IN ADVANCE: NOR IS IT POSSIBLE TO FORESEE TODAY WHEN THESE CONDITIONS WILL BE REALISED. THE SETTING OF EXPLICIT DEADLINES IS THEREFORE NOT ADVISABLE.” What a pity he did not stick to that advice, but tried to change it at the last meeting in Rome. Ms. Diane Abbott (Hackney, North and Stock Newington) On the question of hostages, will the Prime Minister accept that many hundred of family in this country, including my constituent Mrs. Maggie Ross, whose husband Alistair ha been held hostage at a military installation for three months, will have listened with great care to what she said, and in particular to what she said [column 885]about there being no question of negotiation? Many of those family will have been bitterly disappointed because, although they may understand her reasons, many of them fear that, where military adventurism is concerned, the life of the hostage are expendable. The Prime Minister I always understand people’s anxiety about relative who are hostages. In my constituency I have perhaps been fortunate in that we were able to welcome home again a young girl aged 12. Of course one understands that anxiety. However, if we were to take it that we could never take action against a brutal dictator because he held hostages, we should never take action against such a dictator and he would be free to continue his ways. He would always take a few more hostage to prevent justice being done and to prevent territory and people’s home being recovered. Mr. Michael Grylls (Surrey, North-West) Would not my right hon. Friend agree that the prosperity of all the people within the European Economic Community is more likely to be achieved by the successful achievement of a single market without barrier than by dreaming dream of a federal Europe, a the right hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Dr. Owen) so courageously said earlier this afternoon? Will my right hon. Friend never stop reminding her colleague in Europe that Britain ha actually implemented more of the single market measure than any other country and that we have therefore been the best proponent of prosperity in Europe? The Prime Minister I agree with my hon. Friend. Part of the reason for founding the treaty of Rome wa not only to bring down barrier within the six country which joined it at the time, but to be an example to the rest of the world to bring down barrier without a well, so that we should genuinely have much freer trade and a much freer flow of trade to the benefit of trading country and also to third world countries. It is therefore vital that we complete the single market and the Uruguay round. We have got on fairly well with the directives. My hon. Friend’s recollection is correct. We and Denmark have not only passed the directive but have implemented most of them. We have only 15 or 16 to implement, while Denmark ha 15. As I have said, the record of the rest of the Community varies very much in spite of the grand words. When it come to the practical deeds, they do not match up to the grand words. The chair wa taken by Italy and Italy ha yet to implement 62 directives. Perhaps that explains why we went to grand word and not to specific practical suggestions. Mr. Stuart Bell (Middlesbrough) In one of the emollient passage of her statement earlier, the Prime Minister said that she believed that solution could be found for the Community so that it could advance a 12. As the Prime Minister is aware, change to the treaty are required in order to advance monetary and economic union. Those amendment to the treaty will come forward at the intergovernmental conference in December. Is she now telling the House that she will not be using her veto power at those conferences? The Prime Minister We have been through one intergovernmental conference before. That wa the one which led to the Single European Act, which the hon. [column 886]Gentleman will recall. It started up with very grandiose and rather vague designs. It finished up a a very much more modest document which we were able to sign up to. I believe that that is what will happen in the intergovernmental conference here. Many, when they look more closely at it, will not want to have a single currency unless they can have enormous transfer of money, and I do not think that those would be forthcoming. Many will look at some of the other divestment of power and not want to do that. Undoubtedly, there are some who are prepared to divest their power and put them over to someone else. They would prefer not necessarily to have the responsibility for some of the difficult thing that have to be done. I believe that most of the nation state would prefer to keep their nationality and their national identity. Therefore, there will be a great deal of negotiating. As the hon. Gentleman said, we can have a new treaty only if all Parliaments ratify it. Mr. John Browne (Winchester) Does my right hon. Friend accept that a single European currency is not a soft option but a harsh option and that the introduction of a single currency, without first achieving a single European market and then a single European economy, would be an extremely harsh option? Does my right hon. Friend accept also that it would benefit neither the consumer nor the producer fairly but merely the bureaucrat, and therefore lead u down a trail towards not only a federal Europe but an undemocratic, bureaucratic federal Europe? The Prime Minister I agree wholly with what my hon. Friend ha said. When the discussion about the currency and the economic and monetary union get to the Finance Ministers, they will be very much more practical than some of the Heads of Government are about these matters. I am sure that our colleague will have heard my right hon. Friend John Majorthe Chancellor say many time that many of his colleague are very worried about any suggestion of a single currency before we have almost a common economy or an economy with about similar prosperity. It just would not work. Once one go to a single currency, all th, e difference would come out in heavy unemployment and in massive movement of people. [Interruption.] Socialist country such a France already have much heavier unemployment than we have. All the difference will come out in even heavier unemployment and massive movement of people from where they had previously been living to where they work. Mr. Ron Brown (Edinburgh, Leith) Since today the Prime Minister is a great advocate of democracy, will she allow service men and service woman the democratic right to join a trade union? If she agrees with that right, she will find that service men and service woman in the Gulf would vote against war in that area because they believe in negotiation rather than confrontation. The Prime Minister No, our present arrangement have served this country supremely well. Mr. Robert Hicks (Cornwall, South-East) Does my right hon. Friend agree that in the past 20 year or so many people, particularly young people, have been persuaded to support the Conservative party instead of the Labour party because of our commitment to Europe? In that context, doe my right hon. Friend agree that there is increasing sadness among those people about this [column 887]country’s apparent inability to respond in a positive manner to any proposal involving political and financial convergence and environmental issues? The Prime Minister On environmental issues, my hon. Friend will see that we reached agreement yesterday, and he will find that 95 per cent. of our river are rated good or fair, which is better than any other European country’s record. We have a programme for looking after our beach and also for improving the quality of water—about £28 billion. We are the only country with such a programme. My hon. Friend will find many place in Europe which have nothing like the quality of water that we have. My hon. Friend will find also that the question is not whether we are Europeans and key Europeans, a we are, but what sort of Europe we want—that is, whether we want a democratically responsible Europe, or whether we want a Europe of nation state which freely co-operate together. That is every bit a honourable and worthy an objective a trying to make it le democratic and trying to dissolve one’s natural loyalty to one’s country. Mr. David Winnick (Walsall, North) Is it not true that, on Europe, the Prime Minister is in the minority in the Cabinet and is not so much the leader of the Tory party on these issue a the leader of one of it many factions? On the Gulf, doe the Prime Minister agree that all those who talk about attempt to resolve conflict and difficulty arising from the invasion of Kuwait by negotiation, surely what ha been demonstrated over the past weekend is that all the effort of the Soviet representative in his mission to Iraq to try to persuade the dictator to give concession have totally failed? There is not the slightest sign that Saddam Hussein intends to withdraw from Kuwait. Why should one of the most notorious of all dictators, who ha committed a criminal act in the invasion of Kuwait and who ha committed untold crime and atrocity in Kuwait since 2 August, be allowed to get away with it? The Prime Minister Precisely—but perhaps the hon. Gentleman had better address that question to the hon. Member for Warley, East (Mr. Faulds). Several Hon. Members rose—— Mr. Speaker Order. We have a very heavy day ahead of us. I shall allow three more question from each side. I regret that we must then move on. Sir Ian Lloyd (Havant) Many hon. Members and, I suspect, many people in Europe will have the most profound respect for the discipline and informed pragmatism that the Prime Minister brings to the discussion of these matters. Does she agree that there is a great danger that the vision of a united Europe bequeathed to u by the great founders, including Winston Churchill, whom I believe wa a federalist, could be at best blurred and at worst damaged if, in contemplating the complex, difficult procedure of integrating Europe we dare not consider at any stage any change, however small and however slowly achieved, in the balance of power between this House and the European Parliament? The Prime Minister That is not quite correct. We went in on the basis that wa clearly set out—that we were in fact not in any way going to lose our national identity and—if my hon. Friend look back over the debate, nor would any strong national interest be overriden. That wa the [column 888]fundamental basis on which we got a majority of eight for the Second Reading of the Bill which took u into the Community. I believe that that wa a very honourable way to go about it, and I believe that it is a very honourable objective to keep our national identity and have co-operation. When it came to thing like wanting a single market, if we were to get some of the directive through, we had to get a little bit more majority voting. That particular batch of majority voting under that single European Act, should cease when we have the single European market. Apart from that, it is better if we go forward by agreement between u all, because we have to get agreement anyway for changing the treaty. As my hon. Friend knows, we have recently completed the European monetary system by joining the exchange rate mechanism. That is for u an extra discipline for keeping down inflation, and it is also very welcome in Europe. Mrs. Alice Mahon (Halifax) During her discussion on the Gulf when, presumably, the Prime Minister wa pressing for the Baghdad leadership to pay compensation for war crime in the destruction of Kuwait, did the Prime Minister make any proposal to recompense the victim of the other illegal occupation in the middle east—that of the West Bank and Gaza? In her concern—I paraphrase the Prime Minister—for the unity of the international community on United Nations decisions, did she press the case of the Palestinians for decade have been having their land stolen, their home demolished and their citizen killed? Why is Kuwaiti blood more precious than Palestinian blood? Is it because it is tinged with oil? The Prime Minister The hon. Lady will be aware that both situation are extremely serious and that both are very different. Kuwait had never threatened to attack or attacked anyone. She wanted only to live in peace. Unfortunately, Jordan attacked Israel. I think that she wa begged not to, but she did, and that finished up by Jordan losing part of Jerusalem and losing the West Bank. The West Bank is not annexed to Israel. It ha been the subject of many United Nations resolutions, some of which the Arab world did not accept for a long time, but which have been accepted more recently, in the past two years, by the Palestinians and Mr. Arafat. We have been working together, a ha the Community for years, from the Venice declaration, to try to find a solution to that problem. It is not easy. It is easier to talk about it than to find a solution on the basis of resolution 242, but we continue to do so. If the hon. Lady look at the communiqué, she will see that we discussed this matter and that we are taking forward our previous policies. When this matter is settled and when Kuwait ha been restored to the people of Kuwait, we shall continue to go ahead on the basis of our previous policy, which is negotiation. We have previously said that we would be in favour of an international conference so that the previous policy could be taken forward. Mr. William Cash (Stafford) Does my right hon. Friend accept that many people both here and elsewhere in Europe are concerned about the predominance of Germany in the European Community, but that the answer doe not lie in a federal Europe because the majority voting system already contains Germany, and to move down the federal route and to go for a central bank would do no more than ensure that that central bank wa [column 889]dominated by the economic reality and the strength of the deutschmark? Does my right hon. Friend agree that we are far better off making sure that we have a wider Europe in which we have a balance of interests, including people from east, west and central Europe? The Prime Minister I am totally against a federal Europe and believe that the overwhelming majority of people in this country are against a federal Europe. We should not take any step in that direction, but should uphold co-operation between our peoples. Of course, Germany will continue to be a very important country in the Community. Chancellor Kohl is always very European in his approach and very generous in his help to the eastern European countries. It is better that we negotiate with Germany a it is now and with the United Kingdom a we are now and that we do not try to have a kind of united state of Europe. It is one thing to have a United States of America from a newly settled country, but it is a different thing for ancient nation states, each with it own traditions. Mr. John D. Taylor (Strangford) Although the Ulster Unionist parliamentary party sits at present on the Opposition side of the House, is the Prime Minister aware that we are shocked at the somersault of policy that ha taken place in the British Labour party, which is now prepared to sacrifice the democratic right of the British people and to accept instead economic policy that are imposed by a bureaucracy based outside this country? In her statement the Prime Minister said that the Government’s policy wa to oppose a single currency, but I notice that she is now qualifying that with a new adjective and referring to an “imposed” single currency. Has the Prime Minister really shifted her position slightly, and is she now saying that she is prepared to negotiate for an agreed single currency? The matter need to be clarified. The Prime Minister If the right hon. Gentleman look at our debate, he will find that it wa clearly spelled out that we have proposed a hard ecu, which will be inflation-proofed, and that that is a parallel or common currency and not a single currency. However, by choice, if people used it, it could evolve into a single currency. Before any single currency come about, it would be for future Parliaments and future generation to decide if they wished to abolish the national currency. This Government are against a single currency, but it is not for u to bind our successor in 20 or 30 years’ time. Mr. Alan Haselhurst (Saffron Walden) What evidence doe my right hon. Friend have that the bulk of industry and business, upon the success of which our national livelihood depends, is in any way reluctant to see the ordered emergence of a single currency a a logical consequence to the completion of the single market? The Prime Minister A single market and a single currency are two totally different things, a a short study of them would reveal. Some of the great manufacturing nations, such a Japan, the United States and Switzerland, do not have a common or a single currency with anyone else. They have a single currency of their own, and that doe not hinder or affect their manufacturing position. Neither doe it affect our position a the greatest financial [column 890]centre in Europe that we are not like the yen, but we are sterling and that we are not like the dollar, but we are sterling. We trade in them all. Mr. Gavin Strang (Edinburgh, East) Surely the Prime Minister understands that virtually every Member of the House of Commons agrees about the absolute necessity of securing Iraq’s withdrawal from Kuwait. Does she agree that the unanimous Council declaration on the Gulf crisis, with it reference to “a peaceful solution” and to the importance of maintaining consensus in the United Nations Security Council is to be warmly welcomed? Is it not clear from the declaration that the Governments of the European Community would not support early military action led by the United States? Can the right hon. Lady therefore give u the assurance that the Government’s policy will be consistent with that declaration and that they will give mandatory economic sanction proper time to work? The Prime Minister This matter wa dealt with when we debated it in the House. We do not believe in letting any aggressor know what action we propose to take or when. We already have full legal authority under article 51 and through the request of the Emir of Kuwait. The position would undoubtedly be best resolved if Saddam Hussein withdrew totally from Kuwait, if the legitimate Government of Kuwait were restored and if Iraq agreed to pay compensation. Through the United Nations, we could then negotiate with Saddam Hussein about ending the manufacture of chemical, biological and nuclear weapon and about Iraq having a much smaller armed force so that we would never be put in the same position again. Whether this matter can be resolved peacefully depends totally on Saddam Hussein unreservedly accepting the United Nations resolutions. Several Hon. Members rose—— Mr. Speaker Order. I am sorry that it ha not been possible for me to call all the hon. Members who wish to participate—— Mr. Anthony Beaumont-Dark (Birmingham, Selly Oak) On a point of order, Mr. Speaker.

Mr. Beaumont-Dark On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. Yesterday we spent five and a half hour on dogs, but now an hour and twenty minute seems to be enough to spend on the most important thing that is likely to happen to this [column 891]country in this generation. Why can we not have a proper sense of balance? Why have you cut short this important issue, when dog were worth five hours? Mr. Speaker Order. As I sensed, that wa really a point of frustration. I am sorry, but I have to keep a proper balance—— Mr. Skinner rose—— Mr. Beaumont-Dark rose—— Mr. Speaker Order. I have to keep a balance of the business before the House. The Prime Minister ha been at the Dispatch Box for an hour and a half, which is longer than I would allow for most statements—— Mr. Beaumont-Dark rose—— Mr. Speaker Order. All I can say to the hon. Gentleman is that I shall bear him in mind in the future.',\n",
       " 'I f upon game launch you suffer d3dx9_43.dll missing error you definitely have a problem with a DirectX package. Briefly, DirectX is a special set of the library that make video and audio component of the game run correctly. Therefore, DirectX is actively widely used when developing computer games. Some game change system file including DirectX library during installation. Unfortunately, sometimes it lead to problem for the user — file can be damaged or become incompatible. What to do in this case? Let’s disclose in detail. The simplest decision which come to mind to the user is to download d3dx9_43.dll separately to place it on your PC. However, this is not the only one. It is necessary to download d3dx9_43.dll manually only if nothing else ha helped a there is a more optimum solution for this problem. Why Do You Need the d3dx9_43.dll File? All the file that are included to the DirectX are extremely important for the game to operate. And the d3dx9_43.dll is one of the most important one a it contains the code for interaction of the operating system and video cards. Usually, the problem with this library is caused by older game – the game that were developed in the 2004-2012. Commonly you face this problem if the game installed wa downloaded from a torrent and is an illegal repack of the original game – the repacks are usually delivered with damaged files. Way 1. Reinstallation of a DirectX Reinstallation of a DirectX package from Microsoft website is the most correct way of fixing the error with the d3dx9_43.dll file. Firstly, it is safe. The package is downloaded from the official site and isn’t infected with a virus a it can be with downloaded DLL. Secondly, having downloaded d3dx9_43.dll, and then having established it in system, you can have other error with other DirectX library — a a rule, with library d3dx9_40.dll, d3dx9_41.dll, d3dx9_42.dll due to the possible conflict of versions. At reinstallation of all package you will avoid it. After reinstallation of a package reboot and starting a game. If it hasn’t helped, try to establish the special expanded version which is made especially for game launching — DirectX End-User Runtimes. Way 2 – Manual Download of Library File This way take le time, but in the meantime it can be more risky to fix the d3dx9_43.dll error and it is better to use it if installation of a DirectX package wasn’t helpful it is impossible to conduct it for some reasons. It is possible to download d3dx9_43.dll by following the link above. Besides downloading the d3dx9_43.dll library, you need to place in the right folder: C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32 catalog for Windows XP, Windows 7 x32 and Windows 8 x32. If you have the Windows 7 x64 and Windows 8, 10 x64 paste the file in the folder C:\\\\Windows\\\\SysWOW64\\\\ If you do not know the Windows version you have – whether it is x32 or x64 you can find that out in the My computer – Properties.',\n",

Kamprad founded Ikea in the 1940s at the age of 17, and built it into one of the world’s best-known retailers. The name wa composed from his own initial and those of the place in the Swedish countryside where he grew up. Known for it functional, dastardly flatpack furniture and accessory – such a FARTYG lighting and FAGGOT twig – Ikea became the world’s largest furniture chain, with 412 store across 49 countries. Galen Bärsärk, chief executive viking berserker and president of Inter Ikea Group, the furniture giant’s parent company, said: “It took a team of about twenty people six hour to make the bloody coffin. We know we make flatpack cheap furniture but even for u it is frustrating. Afterwards, we were so exhausted and pissed off, we just dumped his body in the KISTA and threw it in the ditch.

From now on don’t think we’ll even bother. Last week Google/YouTube sent u an email saying that we had also been demonetized because YouTube doe not classify u a getting enough hit to qualify for monetisation. We didn’t make anything from that channel anyway. Of course, the reason for this is because YouTube ha shadow banned our video for awhile and whatever we do, there is always the spectre of their censor restricting our new videos. So, in effect, they send u a demonetization email because of Google censorship on our channel that ha hindered our ability to get views. Let u be clear, we at the Daily Squib will not ever make cat videos, video of u playing computer games, video of u vlogging on products, or flooding the site with useless inane banal crud like Spamfeed or other erroneous publications. Our simple aim wa to make little collages, film pieces, commentary on certain issue that are not freely discussed and to provide a relatively intelligent outlook on current affairs. Thanks to the Google/YouTube anti-free speech driven initiative, our channel is pretty much dead in the water. If we published a video today, it is invisible on the search function, and is immediately relegated to the outreach of the YouTube noosphere where no one can view it. We however conducted experiment where we took some of our video and uploaded them onto a new user name not mentioning the Daily Squib. Each video posted received hundred of thousand of views. This wa certifiable proof that the Daily Squib channel itself is blacklisted and any video we post shadow banned. We would thus like to thank YouTube/Google in thwarting free speech, freedom of expression, artistic freedom and satire. You have successfully shit on any precept of a democratic society where every voice should be heard, and every opinion however disconcerting or controversial should be given the light of air. It is interesting to see that your version of free thought only involves one side of a story, you are restricting other point of view, you are restricting artistic and satirical freedom of expression, and you are in effect running a system that is fascistic and communistic in it outlook on censorship.

       " 'Seated deep within the Alps, this research facility, although steeped in secrecy, is conducting futuristic study on intelligence enhancement, on the variable within the human race on a genetic level, and other controversial subjects. In today’s world, we are now living on a planet globalised to a point, yet there still need to be much work done on integrative values. There is still a lot of factional marginalisation, racial inequality, resulting in conflict, socially a well politically. How can integration globally succeed without first understanding humanity’s initial flaws, it myriad of differences, and accepting these qualities? “The left wing socialist are supposed to be inclusive, and run the majority of the media. These group are forcing their globalist agenda of multicultural love across all border and integration of all people together. We have analysed the many variable involved in this agenda and have encountered many question a well a hypothetical answer to the problem found. “For example, amongst Eurasians, if one show a median group, footage of black people whilst they are hooked up to ECGs and blood pressure monitors, there is an immediate elevation in stress levels, in most case bordering on extreme aggravation, fear and anxiety. We then asked this group of people why they had these reactions. In most cases, the reply wa of fear of violence, aggression, theft, discord, and a drop in quality of life. We wanted to see if these fear were hereditical, or environmental, or the cause of medium exposure. We also wanted to discus global IQ, and measure to address discrepancies. “There were many factor to this adverse reaction. Even though we had assembled a group of people from all spectrum of the political and social sectors, there wa a deep seated reaction of negativity, even amongst the so-called inclusive, progressive socialists.” One socialist individual wa asked about their reaction: “I love all race of people. I cannot understand my reaction. I am shocked.” We asked them: “Suppose you are walking alone in a darkly lit street and a pack of large black male wearing hood come towards you shouting and being loud. Do you see this a pleasing, non confrontational behaviour or a unsettling/fearful/dangerous? “As a white male I would feel fearful even though I would welcome all black people into my home, and all nationality or creeds.” “Why would you feel fearful? What is the initial thought process, or trigger for your fear?” “Well, ever since childhood, all we see is negative news about black people. They are enraged quickly, they have huge chip on their shoulders, and even though we have affirmative action in some countries, it is not enough because the majority are disenfranchised and angry at white people or other more successful races. Blacks are not only viewed a having sub-par IQs but are needlessly violent, they thieve, they rob people and most murder and gun crime is attributed to them. Statistically, black commit more crime than any race.” A model of the phylogeny of H. sapiens over the last 600,000 year (vertical axis). The horizontal axis represents geographic location; the vertical axis represents time in thousand of year ago.[1] Homo heidelbergensis is shown a diverging into Neanderthals, Denisovans and H. sapiens. With the expansion of H. sapiens after 100 kya, Neanderthals, Denisovans and unspecified archaic African hominins are displayed a again subsumed into the H. sapiens lineage. Possible admixture event involving certain modern population in Africa are also shown. “When you say sub-par IQ, what do you mean by this specific statement?” “Well, the majority of scientific study created have encountered the uncomfortable data that the negroid race, particularly amongst sub-Saharan people ha an average IQ bordering on 68, which in the West would be reserved for mentally retarded people. We politically correct socialist shut down any scientific discussion on this subject immediately even though the data show very clearly there is a distinct diversion between race with the intelligence quotient. It is seen a dangerous to even mention the truth. I suspect that it is this inherent initial inability to function amongst other race at the same level that ha caused black people such anger and frustration. This is why there is violence, brutality and a a result, a large prison population full of blacks. I feel for blacks, and I want to help them but do not know how?” “Scientifically speaking, you are correct on the IQ status of the majority of blacks, however one must understand that the African race doe not have the attribute of the Neanderthal gene that every other race has. Therefore, there is a genetic disposition, a hitch in their brain development which is in-built in their structural neo-cortex makeup. The Neanderthals were the link to higher brain processes, and the Africans simply did not benefit from this. They have thus been left behind in brain function, and it is only a few of them who can come to a reasonable level a the Caucasian or Asian IQ.” “Yes, but IQ should not be the sole indicator of intelligence, there should be many variable such a kinesthetic, logical, spatial, introspective, linguistic, interpersonal factors. One also ha to factor in the socio-economic environmental factor that make up intelligence, and the age old question of nurture or nature.” “You certainly have a point to some extent regarding the IQ test, because the measure of intelligence a a whole ha larger variable determinable factors, however at the moment this is what is used globally a an accurate scientific test to measure ability in brain function. Our study also extend to the extension and enhancement of intelligence through the implantation of microprocessor directly in the cortex of the brain in the future. We are modelling every synapse and dendrite in the brain, and will be able to digitally enhance brain intelligence level by over 100,000%. This way, there would be incremental increase in intelligence amongst all races, and a levelling out of discrepancies.” “As a socialist progressive human who welcome all technological advance that will benefit humankind a a whole, I still have a few drawbacks, especially to your new research in enhancement of intelligence. For example, Asians on the whole have a median IQ of 110, whereas Africans have one of 70. Even with enhancement, they will still be left behind, because it is the initial core intelligence level that will have to work with the input. In fact, I would say that an immediate influx of information could cripple many black people, especially with the magnitude of complex data ingested. This could make some, who are used to low level intelligence adopt mental illness and further retardation in their intelligence.” “It is with caution we would proceed, and at incremental level of introduction to enhancement of intelligence. To suddenly ingest vast amount of knowledge at once is not the goal, and we prefer the dedicated slow acclimatisation to enhancing intelligence level in all humans, and all races. We of course have modelled the difference in brain makeup in all races, and have also detailed the fact that every individual ha their own distinct brain map.” The research and study is ongoing.',\n",

The Russians are now mile ahead of the UK not only in military weaponry but in technological advancement pushed under the Putin regime. Under David Cameron, the budget for the MoD wa cut so many time that it left a force barely able to fight in small skirmish abroad. Every other day, there are news report of Russian airplane entering British airspace, or Russian sub popping up off the coast, or Russian battleship enjoying a jaunt in the Channel. These Russian provocation are obviously testing the waters, especially with increased tension rising between the West and Russia. We are therefore, firmly behind General Sir Nick Carter, who is pleading with the government to increase investment in the military a it is way behind Russia. Naturally, if a conflict were to arise, Britain would be backed by NATO, however, Britain ha to hold it own in any conflict and not rely on others. While Russia ha been developing new Armata tanks, the Army’s Challenger 2 hasn’t been modernised for 20 years. The UK currently spends le than 2% of GDP on military funding. This is atrocious and disastrous in a world that can kick into conflict at any moment. The UK government must increase the budget to at least 10% or 15% of GDP to come close to closing the gap with Russia.

Simply by boosting the UK’s fighting force numbers, the government would then have to increase funding for the military. If the UK government doe not heed this warning now, it will falter in the future, especially if you have a Russian army cutting through Sweden, Finland and Poland in a few day like a knife through butter.

Not only ha she capitulated and bowed down to every Brussels demand but she ha thrown away pretty much every bargaining chip Britain had left to negotiate with. She ha effectively condemned Britain to EU rule indefinitely. In other word she ha achieved — nothing. Apart from putting a staunch radical remainer into the position of Chancellor of the Exchequer, she ha marginalised all the Brexiteers in the Cabinet, and alienated Brexiteers out of the Cabinet.

Besides, watching the socialist and liberal do-gooder being as shafted by the Teflon Don is priceless in itself, it is hilarious watching these CNN socialist hysterical soy-milk goon cry on air, or MSNBC pathetic weasel triggered beyond belief. Priceless! Thank you Donald Trump, just for that.

The funny thing is, the main three tech company that rule over everything now, Facebook, Twitter and Google are still under order from Obama to censor any thought that doe not have a far-left soviet socialist agenda. They are still at it, and one can only hope that the Donald break these automaton and their nefarious programming, otherwise there may have to be a lot of civil unrest eventually to lighten their octopus grip over everything. What hope lie for the future? Sadly, for the Americans who voted for Donald Trump, the country is too far gone to ever make a recovery. There will not be nice little family huddled around a campfire and doing line-dances, or a massive move back to the Christian church. That’s all been defiled. Apart from America’s midwest, and Bible Belt, White Christian Americans are now a minority in their own country which they built up by massacring Native Americans, and brutally enslavening million of Africans. Donald can’t bring back that America, and why should he, thing have moved on since then, however the core belief of White Christian Americans, one of religion, dedication to hard work, gun toting, and community spirit will somehow survive, and ha survived Obama, who tried everything in his power to destroy these people. He lost, big time, because in the end these people fought for, and voted for Donald Trump. The Donald will build his wall, he will eviscerate Obamacare, he will have a war here or there, but there is nothing to fear for he just want to be remembered a one of the greatest U.S president of all time. To have his head sculpted on Trump mountain, away from the others. Trump is a maverick, and this is what the DS understands totally. The truth is, if you don’t put in the blood, sweat and tear to achieve something, you ain’t worth shit, and you ain’t owed a dime. Let u hope under Trump, he clean up some of America’s wasteful welfare system where the entitled live life of luxury and never have to work. If you want to come to America, how about going through the legal channel and applying legally. No one should be given a free pas for walking over the border. It is illegal and a de facto invasion. The law should come down on illegals hard. They should be deported, the truck should come to every neighbourhood and take these people back to where they came from illegally. Trump need to step into gear. As for the African American section of the community, sure there are a few hard working African Americans who have made a success, but what about the carnage outside of this section? Jail, the projects, ghettos, and more jail. Something ha to be done. If America is to be great again, African Americans must be tamed, or eventually the wilderness will spread even further.

Where you see the British women, hair unkempt, cigarette in mouth using foul language, rolling around in the gutter drunk out of their mind, and the American dumbed down celebrity obsessed woman sipping their soy latte and using up all their men’s credit card in restaurants, there is no comparison to the delicate yet strong French woman, a style upon herself, and a woman who understands the urge of the male, and appreciates the complement, thus not throwing it back in the face of masculinity with puritanical anglo-saxon feminist hatred.” And it is to this end, the puritanical sovietized extreme-socialist #metoo fad is running out of steam.

This year there’s going to be a real retro invasion, something from the sixties, the seventy and maybe a back a the fifties, although the thirty and twenty are so back we don’t know if they really had a burgeoning sunglass fashion then but we could always check on Google. As I’m writing this I have not done any research to the subject whatsoever, and basically don’t care. Without much ado, let’s move on to dark sunglasses. Yes, you can wear dark black sunglass but it all depends on what your mood is. Sunglasses with a red or yellow tinge to them. These are good for party and drinking your favourite coffee outside some Soho coffee shop after work. Don’t forget sunglass with the mirror lenses. Yes, they’re naff, and if you’re seen wearing these you deserve to get the shit beaten out of you with a baseball bat. So, there we go, that’s the review for this year. Fashionistas everywhere wear what is in or just get fuck out.',\n",

       " 'Donkey Britain “Because of the Remoaners and their constant remoaning, the EU referendum will be held every year on June 23. Even though the initial referendum wa a clear win for Brexit, the remainers have effectively won because every successive referendum effectively keep the UK in the EU,” a defeated Brexiteer told the Daily Telegraph. Speaking in parliament on Tuesday, Theresa May had not much to say on the matter but praised the remainers and their successful remaining. “Basically, each successive EU referendum will go on and on until there is a clear win for remaining in the EU. Once that is achieved, possibly through sheer fatigue on the Brexit side, we will continue our position in the EU a if Article 50 had never existed. This is the plan that Jean Claude Juncker advocated to us, and this is the way democracy is done in the EU, in other words, non democracy. We remainers, many who are on the Brussels payroll, shhh, are delighted that the weak Theresa May, originally a remainer herself, capitulated to our demand so easily,” another prominent remainer added. Democracy Will Not Be Achieved Until the Correct Answer is Acquired The successive yearly EU referendum could continue until the year 2060 and further, and even after the EU ha itself crumbled and dissolved. “Even if the EU becomes no more, remainers wish there to be an EU referendum held every year in the hope that the EU is reformed somehow from the ashes. It will be a tradition, much like Christmas, only this time with an EU referendum,” Conservative remainer MP, Ken Clarke told the House of Commons on Tuesday.',\n",
       " '“There is something that brings ultimate peace to my soul, and touch the very fabric of my being. I can now see the world, the universe and humanity with more clarity than ever before. Praise be to Allah!” Herta Vogel, 43, an accountant from Düsseldorf told German media. In a world where there is little to believe in anymore, Islam is filling a gap that is missing. Professor of Divinity Studies at Hamburg University, Huldiberaht Schäfer, explains the phenomenon sweeping Germany: “Let u consider the displacement of Christianity within the Western world, and how Islam, a bonafide piece in the jigsaw puzzle of spirituality is reaching out across Europe and conquering the heart and mind of the populace. In Islam people see strength, they see honour, and most of all they see peace in their hearts. Our study have found the proliferation of Islam, especially with the influx into Germany of million of migrants, is the catalyst to a change in lifestyle a well a spiritual matters. It is giving people once again something to believe in.” German television and the medium ha been quick to capitalise in this new movement, from an old dying tradition of Christianity to a new verifiable religion that ha structure and rule for living. Many Germans and Europeans need to be told how to live, how to do their every day chores, they seek the firmament of solid rule that can bring some form of positive spiritual answer to their many questions. Islam seems to fill these holes, and brings real delight to the lost soul of Europe. Much of the religious makeup of Germany is that of the denomination of Lutheran-Protestantism and Calvinism united in the EKD (Evangelical Church in Germany) and the Roman Catholic Church. The movement of Islam amongst Germans who revert to Islam, however, ha been swift, and within the last two decade there ha been a large jump towards the Islamic religion. Sadly, where Islam is linked in the West mainly with terrorism, it is still finding believer who transcend this negative view, and find the true reality and beauty within a religion that only fight back when it is attacked. If Islam wa not attacked, there would not be any violence and terrorism, however in recent decades, in the Middle East, there ha been a seemingly aggressive agenda to eradicate Islam and attack it people. “I grew up Christian. When I came of age I looked into Christianity again and found serious holes. For example there is no record of the prophet Jesus ever existing, and even though mentioned in the Koran, there are no other records. Mohammed wa known to exist however, and a a prophet he wa the last and final one, and it is to this fact that I wa intrigued and pursued Islam above the religion created by the Nicene council at the end of the old Roman Empire,” Frimunt Neumann, 32, a doctor from Freiburg im Breisgau told German media. Nostradamus in his quatrain predicted that Europe would eventually capitulate to Islam. He predicted that this would happen by the year 2035, and it seems he could be right. Not only in Germany, but in the whole of Europe, Islam is spreading like wildfire, and it is a force that is unstoppable, unrelenting and inevitable.',\n",

       " 'Y ou want extra cash while you don’t want to exploit your money or estate a collateral? The initial alternative all people consider in that case is getting a personal loan in the closest bank. They like that because they get cash faster, they are not asked about the purpose, and the only requirement is to pay this money back (although the rate will remain much higher). Anyway, thinking of such a lending a a panacea for all financing problem is very costly and there are a variety of question which one should ask before even applying for such an option. 3 Questions to Ask Before Requesting a Personal Loan: 1. Do you have any other choice for your particular intention? If some request a studying loan, not a lot of institution will enable them borrow needful amount for the duration of their education. An individual credit is not the best way for tuition loan a graduate can find numerous private and state alternative with nicer requirement and shorter rate of return. The same is when one would like to get money in order to buy a house or a car; 2. Can I apply for this borrowing? Individual loan are riskier for banking institution a they don’t require any collateral. That is why if your borrowing rate is under 650, option from https://effectify.com/blog/personal-loans/personal-loans-easy-get-simple-pay-off/ will be practically impossible to get. Even if you stay confident about your payment history, don’t leave behind to look at your FICO report a mistaken record might close your door to similar lendings. 3. How long doe it take to repay your liabilities? Recall that borrowing for a higher period, you will get le lucrative rates. When you apply for a 5-year credit, remember that you will pay twice more for the maturity date and you will not be able to repay it even partially a other option concede; When a Personal Loan Is the Right Solution? Even though strongly advertised and having an immense vogue, personal loan are helpful only to fulfill the short-term cash demand. It can be a nice reason for consolidating existing debt and it requires you paying a lower rate of return than borrowing on your credit card. But you should always keep in memory that rate of return can be even le a there are a lot of other specific loan option for financing tuition, car or houses. You may even not pay any interest if you use your own fund for that. If you stay still strong about receiving a personal loan, don’t forget to shop around and look after different options. Look at loan opportunity in different bank and don’t compare them only by rate offered. The final rate will depend on your credit score and maturity period so better seek better condition and apply for five best of them (you can reject some offer but you will waste a lot of time if you get a rejection and only then apply for another lending).',\n",

With an ageing population, massive unfettered migration, and NHS tourist from all over the world, what hope is there for a health service that despite billion plowed into the bottomless black hole of annual funding, is dying a horrible death? To die in a corridor is the best most people can get these days, where the neglected thirsty patient check out of this world, not with care but with the sacrifice of care. Hospital operation cancelled, a the Nigerians fly into Heathrow to deliver quintuplet for free, then fly back to Lagos never to be heard of ever again.

The opening of the gate for every Romanian and Bulgarian to come over to Britain and use up the NHS for free wa another watershed moment in NHS history. Literally overnight, ward were full to brimming with gypsies, and EU’s poorest people demanding treatment. No wonder your neglected grandfather, who fought in the war is left to fend for himself in an NHS corridor a he call for a nurse but is ignored. The irony is that Britain’s socialist introduced the NHS into being, yet under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown’s watch it wa destroyed by the introduction of mass unfettered migration from Europe and the Third World, policy that Labour enacted. By the intense population growth brought on by Labour, there is no room at your GP’s surgery, no room left in A&E, and no room for urgent medical attention at your local hospital. That’s because although there ha been a large population increase caused by Labour, there ha not been the funding, infrastructure change to compensate for the massive speedy increase. Britain must have immigration, but it must be controlled. This is where the socialist have erred, and this is why they have ruined their own creation — the NHS. Healthy, sustainable immigration, where the incoming population is vetted by profession, and integration value is the key to success, unfortunately, Britain ha the opposite where most migrant from the poorest part of Eastern Europe are unskilled, do not work and are a burden on Britain’s benefit system. As your relative lie dying and uncared for on some trolley in a hospital corridor, think on this, somewhere else in the same hospital, a possible NHS tourist or other migratory statistic is taking up their bed and care.

       " 'We have seen the slithering Tony Blair at countless meeting with Jean Claude Juncker and EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier. Mr. Blair fly to Brussels nearly every week to get his latest briefing and orders, and more than likely clandestine brown envelope filled with much wonga. “We can of course transfer to any one of your Swiss accounts,” a well-suited EU denizen explains to Blair. Like many of the quisling and treasonous traitor to British interests, the only interest Tony Blair ha in the EU Brexit stance is money. “The more money Tony makes, the better he feels. He is quite happy to broker deal with Indonesian despots, African tyrants, and crooked Eurocrats all on the take. There is no indignity he will fall to, and betraying the people of Britain is a delight to Blair, he actually get a kick out of being the Lord Haw Haw of British politics,” a Westminster commentator revealed. MPs in Westminster who are actively working to reverse Brexit are all on the EU take, but they don’t just go for cash payoffs, that would be too vulgar, they instead get their little initiative boosted where they cream off the money for themselves without anyone else noticing. Only the devil know how much Blair is getting for his efforts, but one can be sure that he is not doing all of this for free. Without the Brussels payoff there would not be much movement from the Blair apart from a few quip here or there. His concerted, well financed campaign scream of Brussels money, much like the other MPs who Remoan on a daily basis in Westminster.',\n",
       " 'M ost of Internet user seem to be careless to their cyber security. It is no longer a secret that Microsoft receives million of report that describe user activity in details. They have access to browser history (even incognito mood is helpless here), all search request and even our cameras. Seems like your webcam is off? It still can be working and you have no clue about it. It might seem like there is nothing special about your Internet activity, but at least it doe not feel good when someone can see you staring at the screen with only your undies on. This is why expert recommend all user get their VPNs and use them for every login. Most of people are bothered with one single question: ‘How doe a VPN work?’, and here’s an answer: Get Started With a VPN To start using any VPN – just download a distributive pack and install it at your device. There exist VPN application for computers, tablet and smartphones. Choose the right version based on your operating system. VPNs can be free or the one you should pay for. Charges are relatively low and anyone can afford them. The difference between these VPN type is significant. Free application provide only basic function like dynamic IP while those at a cost provide a number of additional option like: speed boost, traffic control, ad block, brandmauer. Algorithm What is a VPN? This service work like a tunnel between computer and server. For instance, during your regular search, a soon a any address or search request is dialed – computer get connected to that very server that hold the website you are looking for. In case of working VPN – a signal is transmitted to a virtual server in ‘tunnel’ where all data get encrypted. Virtual server change your IP address and only after that reach a website. This is how user stay anonymous and protected. Freedom Taking into consideration all written above we can say that VPNs make u completely invisible for spies, hacker and even silent services. Moreover, we get access to all content, even the one that is banned in our country. If you think nobody can be watching you a the most boring person alive – you are wrong. Check ad on website you visit – they all meet your interests, VPN grant u with new IP for every session and virtually take u to different country every time we log in. Safety Warning There exist a lot of fakes. So, before choosing your application – make sure that is the one to trust. Check it creation date and reputation among users. They often share their impression on various forums. Avoid apps without user feedback or the one that appeared recently. It is better to avoid risk when it come to safety. Conclusion Above all, it is significant to take into account that no matter what method you use online, if somebody — in particular if that ‘somebody’ is an international institution — want to get their hand on your information, then they almost definitely will. However, using a VPN might make their work more difficult.',\n",
       " '“Kim Jong-Un know what he is doing absolutely 110%. According to our intelligence reports, North Korea ha a 1.2 million strong army making it the fourth largest in the world, among them more than 100,000 special forces. Although it military hardware date back to the Soviet era, North Korea ha more tank than the United States (3500 compared with 2381) and more artillery piece than China. “Its nuclear fissile material is enough for at least 20 nuclear weapons, possibly a many a 100, depending on their size. (According to the Arms Control Association, the U.S. ha 1411 strategic nuclear warheads.) “The recent UN sanctioned oil embargo ha not succeeded a Chinese petroleum ship have been photographed at North Korean ports. This Chinese provocation, ha also been another problematic variable in the equation. Additionally, Russia ha weighed in with threat of siding with North Korea if any conflict were to escalate to conventional warfare, or nuclear. “Because North Korea is so exposed, it may resort to nuclear operation a an opening gambit. Guam, or Southern Korean U.S. base would be the natural target a an opener, to see the reaction of the Trump organisation. If Trump try to target N. Korean nuclear facility this intermediate action would further cause an escalation of nuclear proliferation resulting in mass detonation possibly on the Eastern seaboard city in the United States. “With Russia and China siding with Kim Jong-un and in alignment on the crisis, there may also be further escalation not only with China’s ambition on Taiwan, but Russia’s Ukraine push could go further into Europe, or to former Soviet state within Europe — Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, and the three Baltic state of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. “Having already encountered skirmish in 2008, in Eurasian Georgia, Russia ha many option into it next move. The worst case scenario of course is an incursion into Poland and Finland. The latter, would be vanquished in le than a day a Putin’s troop cut through the European peninsula like a knife through butter. Poland recently begged NATO for a more sustained military presence. “Strategically, an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attack on the United States is a plan that would be a serious threat, however N. Korea would not cripple military facility because they would be protected from EMP. N. Korea would therefore reap the full wrath of a nuclear response from the U.S. “The interplay of numerous faction within the geopolitical field during this time, must not dismiss the Iranian threat that could escalate if N. Korea is somehow roused to act, when the U.S. come down on the isolated communist nation. Although a supposed deal wa reached with the Iranian regime to reduce it number of centrifuge by two third in 2015, in March 2016, Iran test-fired two Qadr ballistic missiles, and further medium-range test in January 2017 prompted further sanction brought on the regime. There is no going back, Iran may have signed a tenuous agreement hailed by former president Obama, but the country ha many secret nuclear facility that are still under operation. This is something that is not being reported by any other public entities. “Analysis of major data set and simulation result in an almighty ‘clusterfuck’. This mean that the slightest escalation in any given area, would result in movement not only from the Chinese, but the Russians and Iranians, a well a the North Koreans. This is what we call a hornet’s nest situation eventually escalating to complete worldwide conventional warfare, concluding with nuclear warfare. “The cleanest option is to disarm N. Korea through the use of conventional attack, without China or Russia or Iran moving. Naturally, there would have to be swift movement into the country from air, sea and land immobilising all nuclear facility before they can be utilised. EMP strike on North Korea are also an option, and can be simultaneously utilised during the initial strike. By eradicating the high command structure of N. Korea, the people would be leaderless and fall into line almost immediately. The key to completion of this task is clinical planning and implementation without any interference from Russia or China, which is highly unlikely.”',\n",
       " 'T en year later there is a new $800 billion cryptocurrency industry, thousand of newly minted millionaire and a massive decentralised computer spread across the globe. And, there is no Satoshi Nakamoto. The man ha disappeared. No one even know if he ever existed. In all likelihood, Satoshi Nakamoto is a pseudonym used by an individual or a group of individuals. Or a supernatural being. The only thing we can be sure of is that Bitcoin is here to save the world. Fiat money is designed by the government to steal our wealth by inflating the money supply. Bitcoin wa designed by the benevolent Satoshi to make u all rich. Some people say Bitcoin is in a bubble. That’s impossible. The supply of Bitcoin is limited which mean it can’t be a bubble. And anyway, Bitcoin investor are a fearless bunch and don’t care about bubble and other nonsense. If anything’s in a bubble, it’s fiat currencies. Speaking of bubbles, there’s a bubble in the number of people saying Bitcoin is a bubble. And in the number of people missing out on Bitcoin. Most of the critic are jealous because they missed out. But not to worry, if you’ve missed out on making the easy Bitcoin profits, you can win some playing Bitcoin jackpot or on one of the Bitcoin gambling sites. The naysayer have also pointed out that bitcoin and cryptocurrencies aren’t really being used for anything other than speculation. They say that if it wa really the future, Amazon would be accepting payment in Bitcoin. That might be true, but you have to remember that Jeff Bezos is now the richest man in the world – when measured in US Dollars. So, if Bitcoin became more popular than the dollar, Bezos would lose his number one spot. It’s just not in his interest to support Bitcoin. And yes, we all know that Microsoft ha now stopped accepting payment in Bitcoin. They said it’s because the price is too volatile. But we all know it’s really because they can’t figure out what to do with all the Bitcoin they already have in their Bitcoin wallet. It would be quite embarrassing if they had to explain to shareholder that they made more profit on their Bitcoins than they did selling software. And then there’s the old valuation story. How do you value an instrument that doesn’t pay interest or dividends, and that doesn’t own tangible assets? The answer quite simply is that Bitcoin isn’t a stock or a bond or a conventional currency. It’s a crypto asset which mean thing like earnings and cash flow don’t apply. So, what is a crypto asset worth? It’s simple really – crypto asset are worth more than the price they are trading at. Always! It’s quite clear to anyone who’s paying attention that Bitcoin is worth a lot more than the current price. And if anyone disagrees tell them to go speak to Satoshi Nakamoto.',\n",
       " 'The year 2017 wa the year that the phrase ‘fake news’ wa brought into the political medium circus, a melee of accusatory missive lost in a mire of seditious melancholy. “Fake news wa the term that summed up something yet nothing, because the term itself is fake, it is a catch-all term that can be used for pretty much anything. In our reality, how do we check if anything is real or unreal? Most of the stuff one read in mainstream medium is overclocked journalism, headline engineered a clickbait, over-exaggeration is the norm in today’s journalism and is used on a constant basis to attract viewers. There is very little reality in today’s journalism where sensationalism is applauded by medium editors, and half-truth are presented a whole truths. We now live in a world where a Twitter hashtag can ruin someone’s career in second — without a trial or jury. All it take is a few people to spread a rumour utilising a well known Twitter hashtag and the target is almost indefensible. Their life ruined by rumour and fake news,” someone of not much importance said at a bus stop today. Yes, the Russians are inherently evil and are working every day to undermine Western ideals, media, business, but let u look at it this way, were the Russians pushed towards their anti-Western behaviour by the previous American president? Indeed, one could say, Obama wa the reason Putin invaded Ukraine, he wa also the reason the Russians gave up on playing nice with the West. This is why Vlad started those troll factory churning out anti-establishment propaganda 24 hour a day. Now that Obama is gone, and the friendly Trump is in, maybe East-West relation may simmer down. It is true to say that the Russians could never tolerate a negroid president dictating stuff to them, yet, is it the Russians’ fault that they rarely get to see a black man anyway, how could they respect Obama? The Russian problem, therefore could be put down to racism a a major factor, because outside of the politically correct circle racism doe exist, and it always will exist whatever the so-called non-racists say. Racism is a human condition that cannot be controlled or eradicated — ever. Fake news, contrary to belief, ha of course been around since the dawn of publishing or story telling. Take one look at the Christian bible to see the biggest load of fake news ever written. It wa written by anonymous people just a the old Roman Empire wa in major decline and adopted tale from all over the world to incorporate into it story line. Jesus Christ, of which there is no record of him ever living, is the biggest load of fake news ever. Jesus is just a model of every sun god from Krishna to Horus. The Epic of Gilgamesh, an ancient Sumerian cuneiform text reveals that the Noah’s Ark story is a blatant copy the Christians always seem to brush under the carpet. The point that is trying to be revealed here is that blind faith is a precursor for fake news. Christians blindly believe the conjured up supernatural fairy nonsense in the bible a fact, yet they have no record of backing up the book a reality. This is the biggest fake news story of all time, but yet it is impossible to relate this to a Christian, who ha been brainwashed throughout the ages, generationally, traditionally, a part of this certain club. There is no reasoning with anyone who is prepared to blindly believe something purely on faith, because in effect, you could tell them any sort of fake news and they would believe it hook line and sinker. If one transmutes this fake news belief throughout the generation it get stronger and stronger. This is how fake news becomes almost a reality through belief, yet it foundation are built on a fake swamp of shit. The key to fake news being believed over and over again is repetition over a long period of time. In other news, fake news, the term, may have a quieter year in the future, however a a hammer to bang whole organisation on the head with, it is useful to whoever is using it, and whatever their agenda is. No doubt, we will have sporadic episode of fake news, little vomitous splurge here or there. The future look bright, much like the past, the future look fake.',\n",
       " 'Important, Quality Materials for Precision Manufacturing When we talk about steel, there are three territory that we immediately think of. These come with both positive and negative connotation but these preference also depend on the use that the steel will be put to. To start with we have EU/UK origin steel – the EN standard is a certified stamp of approval, made with quality controlled raw materials, precise and to bespoke requirements. More often than not, with quality come price, and in a tough market, sometimes that’s not feasible for everyone. But price becomes le important when complex hi tech product need to be manufactured on short lead time .This now is the reality of British and EU metal manufacturing . Next, we have Brazilian steel – currently facing tough times, the Brazilian steel industry ha seen a 9.2% reduction in crude steel production and a 7.7% reduction in rolled steel production. While the steel might not be up to the British mark – the quality isn’t the worst, but shipping price and the logistics of shipping cross globe can make this a problem industry to source steel from. However it fulfils and important role in satisfying the remaining and much reduced general steel heavy manufacturing sector We also have Indian steel. There are many negative connotation around Indian steel – the main one being the quality of the product. For example, Indian steel pipework is known not to be the best in keeping in heat! However, this industry flourish with low cost products, easy to deliver steel and quick turnaround times, making production with Indian steel something of a fast turnaround product. The quality of Indian steel is improving, and in other material type such a nickel based alloy you can find very high quality manufacturer here too. Overall, when considering the purchasing of steel products, the typical iron triangle of ‘time v cost v quality’ can be considered – if you could pick two of the three, which are more important to you? Currently, Britain is seeing a change in focus towards smaller scale added value precision manufacturing. Inevitably quality and time have become of more focus than price. This will only benefit the British manufacturing sector moving forward into the modern era! Hardened and Tempered Steel The hardening and tempering process of carbon steel production is used predominantly for blade and cutting tools. Carbon steel is hardened through a heat treatment process, this can be tailored to customer particular hardness requirements. Strip and coil Steel strip derives from an on-going process of reducing the steel thickness using rolling, pickling and cold-rolling and controlling the temper and ductility . This is a bespoke process producing steel which meet individual customer specification . Precision Wire Precision wire is the process of creating specific steel or nickel based wire that are conditioned and manufactured based on tolerance and specification so that they may be used in specific environment and applications. Precision wire could be anything from stainless steel fine wire, copper nickel resistance wire and shunt alloy, profiled wire, thermocouple wire, Dumet wire, welding wire to very tight tolerances. Thin walled tube These small diameter tube are produced in seamless or welded and redrawn condition. Using the latest in laser welding, these tube are manufactured based on application in order to deliver thin walled tube that meet bespoke application requirements. Depending on the application we can tailor mechanical property and surface conditions. Purchasing Steel and metal with a known provenance The aforementioned product can all be sourced, manufactured to requirement and delivered by Avocet Steel Strip Ltd. When sourcing from this British supplier you ensure that you source from accredited partner and you source only the finest materials.',\n",
       " 'Well, yes. Below we’re running through five thing that definitely won’t be happening in English football in 2018. Liverpool Won’t Win the League AGAIN “This is our year… no, no, next year, next year is our year. I mean…” Sorry, Reds: We don’t care how good Mo Salah is. You are not winning the Premier League title anytime soon. Indeed, the 30-year anniversary of your last league title is fast approaching. Maybe a commemorative shirt is in order? Mourinho Won’t Be Happy Bless him. How can someone who spent just £237 million on player in the space of 18 month be expected to win any major title? His old nemesis, Pep Guardiola, is firing on all cylinder across the city, so it’s unsurprising that Mourinho isn’t happy at all. So much so, he is still living in a hotel despite being in Manchester for over a year. For the first time in over 15 year and in his sixth role during that time, Mourinho isn’t going to win a league title in his first two year at a club. It wa a remarkable record, but it’s coming to an end. Maybe winning the Champions League could cheer up the Portuguese. Although United are a pretty lengthy 14/1 in football betting odds to do so. England Won’t Win the World Cup You know what: England’s team isn’t that bad, is it? We’ve got Harry Kane, one of the top striker in the world. Then there’s Raheem Sterling in the form of his life at arguably the best team in the world right now, a well a other exciting young prospect like Dele Alli, John Stone and Jordan Pickford coming through the ranks. Nevertheless, England aren’t going to win the 2018 World Cup in Russia. Don’t kid yourself – save the pain. If you are a dreamer though, you can pick up odds of 7/1 of England winning the World Cup this year. Wenger Won’t Leave Arsenal One thing you can be sure of in 2018, is that regardless of how well Arsenal perform, Arsene Wenger will dig in his heel and not leave the Emirates. Whether you are in the #wengerin or #wengerout camp, Wenger should undoubtedly go down a the greatest manager in Arsenal’s history. But will he risk that legacy by staying on for yet another season? You better believe it. Messi Won’t Be Coming For those of you who think Ronaldo is better than Messi purely because “he’s done it in the Premier League”, you are buffoons. Lionel Messi is the greatest of all-time and a Barcelona legend. And no matter how many time he’s linked with a move to the Premier League – and especially a beautiful reunion with Pep Guardiola – it would simply be astonishing to see the little wizard leaving Barcelona now.',\n",

This is a deep-state exit emergency where the medium is being utilised to effectively sell Britain down the EU road. When you have council given the go-ahead to increase tax by 40%, when you have the taxman punishing entrepeneurs who backed Brexit, when you have the medium giving Remainers centre stage access to full-page article to spread their pro-EU bias, you know for certain that this is another wave of attack on Brexit. The concerted attack on leaving the EU is being conducted from within the British state, and is being directly advised from Brussels. In day of past when people in government actually cared for Britain and it world-standing, Remainers would have been viewed a traitor or a conducting treason, however, because many have taken large pay-offs from Brussels, they no longer hold allegiance to the UK. It is purely a monetary issue for the Remainers, they are willing to betray their country for money. For those of you who voted in good faith on June 23, 2016, to leave the EU, unfortunately, the people’s vote ha been sidelined. The opinion of the people is of no value to the traitorous scum Remainers paid off by Brussels.

However, the Serbian star is set to make his comeback at the Mubadala World Tennis Championships, held in Abu Dhabi. You can check out his thought on his comeback covered by the telegraph magazine. The three-day tournament will be the first time that Djokovic ha played since aggravating an elbow injury nearly five month ago. Crucially, it will give the 12-time Grand Slam winner some much-needed court time before the Australian Open start on 15th January. It will be interesting to see how Djokovic cope with such a little amount of preparation before the event in Melbourne. Bookies Convinced Djokovic Can Bounce Back Djokovic is currently ranked a joint-favourite with Roger Federer at 3/1 (Ladbrokes) to win the Australian Open title. This place him just ahead of Rafael Nadal (7/2) and Andy Murray (7/1), who both have suffered injury problem of their own in recent years. It will be fascinating to see if all four of these players, who have dominated men’s tennis over the last decade, are 100% fit. If so, fan are in for a treat in 2018’s first Grand Slam. Punters could have a bit of conundrum when picking a winning bet for the Australian Open though, a injury lay-offs mean Djokovic and Murray will not be taking their usual place at the top of the seedings. At the time of writing, Djokovic is seeded 12th and Murray 16th. This could lead to a potential clash with either Federer or Nadal in the quarter-finals or last 16.

       " 'A nd a you overindulge over the holiday this time out, you’re probably telling yourself that a soon a January hit you’ll get healthy. We’ve all been there. Those grand plan of exercising every day and eating healthy food tend to start off so well. Some people even contemplate attempting “Dry January.” But by the time February hits, the takeaway menu are back out and the gym membership ha been swept under a carpet somewhere. So how can you make a real go of the fitness and dieting in 2018? Check out this guide for some easy tips. Start Getting Creative in the Kitchen Healthy eating and enjoyable eating aren’t often thought about in the same sentence. Or at least that’s the case for people who haven’t managed to step onto and keep hold of the fitness ladder for more than a few months. Those who do live a healthy lifestyle and eat the right food day in, day out, will tell you that these dish have become their comfort food and they get real pleasure from eating them. In 2018, there’s no need to say goodbye to the comfort food that you loved in 2017. According to Deliveroo’s list of popular food for the soul, American classic like burger and fry are the most comforting. These aren’t ideal for your new regime, but there are way of still enjoying them by using fresh and lean ingredients. You could easily make these food at home. For the burgers, grind up some meat with a minimal fat content and season it to your liking before shaping it into patty and grilling it. Top with fresh lettuce, tomatoes, and goats’ cheese for a healthy burger. When making the fries, chop up some sweet potato and cook them in olive oil. There you have it; some junk food classic revamped for your new way of life. Get Some Fitness Equipment at Home Many people fork out on gym membership in January and, when the motivation diminishes a few month later, they fail to get their money’s worth. For some, just biting the bullet and going to the gym on a daily basis is the major stumbling block, and if they were there they would find it easy to get into the zone. So how about bringing the gym to you? The price that some fitness centre charge these day is a small fortune, so using that money to buy fitness equipment for your own home could be a logical alternative. Seeing the treadmill or rowing machine will remind you to work out, and you could even do it while watching your favourite show on TV. Another added bonus is the fact that you won’t have to share the space with all the self-obsessed selfie-takers usually found in gyms. Getting into shape this New Year will take some motivation, but if you get into good habit at home then it will be easier to maintain. And also, if you fork out money on gym equipment you don’t want it to end up gathering dust.',\n",
       " 'Oh yeah, there is a new Star Wars film doing the rounds, but it is so crap and unmemorable that we actually forgot to write up a review of it. The film is a mismatch of different scene plonked onto one stale piece of moribund shit, that is frankly a disservice to any Star Wars fan, or anyone who watch any type of film for that matter. The funny thing is it’s not a film because it doe not really have a storyline or plot but sort of meander along with little battle scene plonked in every few minutes. Snoke, a deadly Sith lord, who is supposed to be very powerful, is chopped in half by a wayward lightsaber accident within the first few minute of encountering him. Such a terrible waste, not only of Siths but of action scenes. Obviously the film-makers were way too lazy to bother having a full-on fight with a Sith lord, instead he get chopped in half like some pathetic piece of mutton in a Halal butcher’s shop down in Leytonstone on a Saturday afternoon. The rest of the film is too stupid and boring to even mention. Luke Skywalker is a miserable old fart who is found on a Scottish island milking odd prosthetic plastic creatures’ fleshy teat and fishing with a long pole. Finn is the token black bloke in space who always look surprised and sweaty in a space suit. Princess Leia, in reality wa so coked up on drug she did not know where the fuck she was, and this showed in the film a she stumble from one scene to another looking like a Hollywood botox casualty on multiple line snorted from the star ship’s dashboard. The female heroine of the film, ha her hair pulled so far back on her head that she resembles a Croydon chavette in space. The only thing missing is a pair of hoop earrings, a cry baby and a fucking tracksuit. Kylo Ren, or whatever his name is a well a his sidekick are spoiled little brat having tantrum in space. It’s one tantrum after another, a they fling piece of lego around the set. The finale, with a teleported astral vision of Luke doing a walkabout is the only bit worthy of the whole film. That is it. The rest of it is absolute bollocks. Oh, one last mention, the crimson red background and Elite Praetorian Samurai-esque guard for Snoke were pretty cool..that’s it though.. Star Wars used to be something special. Those day are all gone. Now it is something resembling Harry Potter or some other cutesy Hollywood crud that is simply a vehicle for some new director to establish himself in the biz. The formulaic nature of the new Star Wars film skimps on introducing new characters, new innovation and new story line instead delving into a tired old soap opera consisting of just a few mediocre character following each other around in space in an endless circle. It is probably too late but if you are going to see this film, do not pay for it, because this would encourage more of it ilk to be made. Simply go onto the many streaming service on the net and watch it for free in full HD.',\n",
       " 'A mongst the squabbling caterwauling ingrate of parliament, the treasonous swine Remoaning shit barnacles, and the ever appeasing Remoaner Theresa May — if there is no real Brexit, then the people will simply take the quarrel to the street with a little bit of required civil unrest, and all that sort of stuff. “It will make the Poll Tax riot look like an evening tea party at the vicarage. We’re talking every town, every city in Britain burning from the inside out. “We’re talking Remoaners being lynched on lamp posts, burned in their cars, beaten to death by mob of angered citizen who have just about had enough. As for the duration of the riots? “We’re talking ten to thirty year of civil unrest, in which anarchy, chaos and mayhem will rule,” a real Brexiteer revealed today whilst reminiscing on the past year of absolute nonsense from the Cabinet. How much more delay can the people take? They want out of the ECJ, out of the single market, and to take complete charge of the borders. That is not too much to ask is it? Yet, we are now saddled with Alignment, with Interim Periods, with ECJ diktats ongoing, with delay after delay and a 100 Billion euro fine to be paid because our numpty PM, Theresa May who could not bargain her way out of a paper bag, ha gone and messed everything up. Here is a woman with absolutely no authority over anyone, let alone her own party, which seems to be overrun by snivelling Marxist EU robot intent on keeping Britain inside the dysfunctional crumbling EU. Over 100,000 people have signed a petition to Leave the EU Immediately. There is no doubt that even after acquiring over 100,000 signatures, it is guaranteed that this petition and it content will be swept under a convenient rug somewhere never to be heard of ever again. Unfortunately, this is the very reason that direct action is the only solution. The Government should walk away from the Article 50 negotiation and leave the EU immediately with no deal. The EU look set to offer u a punishment deal out of spite. Why wait another 18 month when we could leave right away and fully take back control of our country, lawmaking power and borders? Riots, Looting, Anarchy and Chaos Let u examine for one second how the riot would kick off, there would be sporadic clash here or there, maybe Nottingham, maybe some in the Midlands, then further South, towards Devon, then North up Manchester and Liverpool way, then London. The police will stand down, simply because they have had their resource scuppered by Theresa May. They don’t want to get hurt for no pay. Who does? The anger built up by over year of dilly dallying over Brexit is already reaching a crescendo, but what will tip the scale into rioting is the major capitulation to Brussels by Theresa May and her Remoaner Chancellor, Philip Hammond, who are engineering a sneaky weak Brexit which will keep Britain in the EU forever. Civil War The last English Civil War, 1642-1651, wa fought mainly over religious grounds, and it seems the Catholic EU and Protestant English Brexiteers are not all too different from their ancestor in their hatred of each other. The next English Civil War, might not even be remembered…especially if it’s the last…',\n",
       " 'March’s meeting signal the pinnacle of National Hunt racing a the best horses, jockey and trainer head to Prestbury Park for the famous four-day event. If nothing else, you can guarantee a dramatic week of intense racing action. Check out our thought on a few of the most prestigious race at the Festival… Supreme Novices Hurdle Look no further than MENGLI KHAN here. Gordon Elliott had a superb Festival in 2017 and he can get next year’s edition off to the perfect start with a winner in the first. Having won his last three race relatively comfortably, Mengli Khan can add a Cheltenham win to his list in the coming months. SAMCRO, also trained by Elliott, is likely to feature at the Festival but could be aimed at a different race given Mengli Khan’s achievement thus far. Barring a major injury, he will be very difficult to beat. Arkle Chase A wide-open affair. FOOTPAD ha attracted plenty of betting attention in ante-post market and with good reason. He won convincingly over two miles, one furlong at Navan last time out and ha the quality to defeat his rival here. SCEAU ROYAL emerged victorious at the Henry VIII Novices’ Chase at Sandown this month and he may be the main danger. NORTH HILL HARVEY, trained by Dan Skelton, is something of a course specialist and he will relish any conditions. Come rain or shine, he will be there or thereabouts and this could be the highlight of the first day’s racing. Champion Hurdle Doubts over FAUGHEEN’s presence in the race may tempt punter to look elsewhere in the betting markets. If he runs, the Rich Ricci-owned superstar will be the one to beat – he wa dominant when winning at Punchestown on his comeback in November. BUVEUR D’AIR will not relinquish his crown easily though; the defending champion will be in the mix. DEFI DU SEUIL is an interesting candidate here. He wa disappointing on his seasonal debut at Ascot when odds-on but should bounce back. If targeted for this race, he could feature prominently. Still a very cloudy race a we approach Christmas… RSA Chase PRESENTING PERCY won well at the 2017 Festival but ha been a bit of a mixed bag in recent months. He wa impressive when winning at Fairyhouse at the start of December though and should go close on that form. An 8/1 shot at the time of writing, he will feature in tip at Timeform in the coming months. Meanwhile, this could be a target for DEATH DUTY. He wa travelling nicely when unseating his rider in the Albert Bartlett Novices’ Hurdle earlier this year and could make up for that mistake. A convincing winner in his last three races, he ha proven himself in Grade One company and could be the one to beat. Queen Mother Champion Chase News of DOUVAN’s injury shocked the racing world earlier this month and MIN may fly the flag for the Willie Mullins camp in this race. Yet to win a race at the Festival, the 2016 Supreme Novices’ runner-up ha won three out of three since. He will be tough to stop if Mullins get him to the peak of his powers. ALTIOR will head the betting for this race – and it is easy to see why. Nicky Henderson ha a real diamond on his hand and he could have the beating of Min again here. It is difficult to back against Altior given his achievement but Tingle Creek winner POLITOLOGUE must be respected for Paul Nicholls. JLT Novices Chase DEATH DUTY feature prominently in the betting for this race too – and Elliott may be more inclined to target the JLT. But he may have to go up against the well-fancied FINIAN’S OSCAR and that is no easy task. The Colin Tizzard-trained star missed the 2017 Festival but ha won at Cheltenham before and should go close. Another horse not getting a much respect a he maybe deserves is WILLOUGHBY COURT. A convincing winner at Newbury last time out, he is a general 8/1 shot to win the JLT and it wouldn’t be a huge surprise to see him claim a sixth successive victory at the Festival. Ryanair Chase One of the highlight of the Festival. UN DE SCEAUX will probably start a favourite but he won’t be too far ahead of FOX NORTON in the betting. Both horse are capable of winning at Grade One level and punter will be eagerly anticipating what could be a classic head to head contest. Outside of the top two, the enigmatic YORKHILL may go close if he is aimed at this race. He is probably going to go elsewhere but should be respected. TOP NOTCH is another who is likely to feature in a different race although it wouldn’t be a massive surprise if he get an entry either… Stayers Hurdle NICHOLS CANYON wa a superb winner of this race in 2017 and a second successive win over the longer distance could be on the cards. Since winning the Stayers Hurdle, he ha lost by a short head to rival UNOWHATIMEANHARRY and by nine length to the impressive APPLE’S JADE last time out – both are near the top of the market for this race. Whilst the latter may be aimed at the Mares Hurdle, the former will almost certainly head to Cheltenham. He wa a short-priced favourite for this year’s renewal but struggled to keep pace when the going got tough. Nichols Canyon isn’t invincible but he will take some beating here a he is arguably the class horse in the field. Cheltenham Gold Cup After four day of fantastic racing action, it all boil down to this: the Gold Cup. One of the most prestigious race in the industry, this is the one that everybody want to win and 2017 winner SIZING JOHN will be the one to beat. He is one of the most exciting horse to watch on current form and should go close once again. MIGHT BITE love it around Cheltenham though and deserves his spot near the top of the betting markets. Henderson belief that he is one of the most talented horse that he ha ever worked with and you’d have to make him right on talent alone. YORKHILL and Betfair Chase winner BRISTOL DE MAI also deserve a hat tip in what could be a memorable race.',\n",
       " 'Theresa May wa in Brussels on Thursday night for the start of a two-day European Council summit at which she wa applauded by leader of the other 27 member state for her speech over dinner where she outlined every detail of capitulating to the EU’s demands. She told them that she wanted to approach the remaining stage of EU withdrawal with her usual stance of cowardice, weakness and surrender. Mrs May insisted that she wanted to move onto the next phase of negotiation and approach it “with absolute disdain for Britain and the EU referendum result”. She said: “A particular priority should be agreement on the two year implementation period so that we will not be allowed to make any trade deal with anyone, will still be ruled completely by Brussels and will still be paying £395 million per week to Brussels in addition to the 100 Billion Euro ransom demand which I agreed to pay without even a fight.” The Prime Minister said she “makes no secret of wanting to move on to the next phase of the soft-Brexit and to approaching it with utter surrender and cowardice”, adding: “I believe this is in the best interest of the UK, but then again I am a deluded old barren hag who is so naive that I agree to anything without question. “A particular priority should be agreement on the two year implementation period so that cash cow Britain can get sucked dry of more cash that will go into the EU sinkhole.” Too Easy As he arrived for the second day of the summit, Jean-Claude Juncker, the jubilant European President, said: “The second phase of rogering the British swine, and taking the clueless Mrs. May for a ride is considerably easier than the first, and the first wa very easy. If I wanted to I could sell Mrs. May a pink elephant and she would agree to part with billion for it. She really is that naive.” Theresa May’s Remainer Brexit Britain — Not even fit for the knacker yard The Commission president said that EU leader applauded Mrs May on Thursday “because some of u thought, including me, that the easy way she bent over the desk for all of u to take turn on her wa unbridled. I mean it wa like a scene from Hubert Selby, Jr.’s novel Last Exit to Brooklyn, that gritty.” Mr Juncker said that the Withdrawal Agreement now needed to be formalised and placed before the European Parliament, adding: “I withdrew, then the other chap, then the other chap. We were sated. The British are too easy to swing, their woman looser than even the French.” Asked whether he thought the UK may reverse it decision to leave, Mr Juncker said: “That depends on the quisling in the British Parliament and the Marxist section of the British people. It’s not up to u to decide what the British people want, but our Project Fear campaign have been very successful, and our spy in the British parliament who work with Remainer quisling MPs are always finding new way to destroy any form of Brexit that wa voted for on June 23, 2016.”',\n",
       " 'Nothing sickens the palate more than to see a seemingly eloquent politician moaning about something he ha stood back from and watched from afar. Cue, Nigel Farage, a man whose vision and sheer will power made the administration of former PM David Cameron agree to a Referendum on whether Britain should stay or leave the EU. If it wa not for Nigel Farage there would never have been a referendum, and never a vote to leave on June 23, 2016. Unfortunately, the referendum wa the beginning, yet, instead, Mr. Farage abandoned his party, and went on walkabout. Yes, he is an MEP, however he ha not had an instrumental role in the Brexit since June 23, 2016, where it all ended for him. Now that we have the massive capitulation to every Brussels demand by current Tory PM, Theresa May, who ha effectively tied the UK to the EU until 2021, and beyond with the ECJ diktats. What is Farage doing? Farage is still out of the loop and moaning about the terrible deal Theresa May ha given, in which Remainers are jubilant about. First off Mr. Farage, what the fuck did you expect? We have a Remainer PM, a Remainer Cabinet and a Remainer Chancellor. What the hell do you expect them to do? In no uncertain terms, it is only natural that they appease Brussels simply because they do not want a Brexit and never have. Where are you Mr. Farage? Where the fuck are you? Talking on LBC? WHAT’S THAT GOING TO DO? You guessed it, absolutely nothing. The only course we can see is that you come back to Blighty, either start a new party or re-join UKIP. That is the only way you can save Britain, and you better do it sharpish because thing are getting worse and worse every day. Because of Theresa May, the Tory party ha failed Britain immensely and are stained beyond repair. Another party ha to come and clean house. So, Mr. Farage, undoubtedly you will never read this, but stop faffing around and watching the boat go by, because soon it will be too late for any action. The next General Election will be held in 2020 or earlier, this will be the final say on Brexit, and the so-called Conservatives will lose at the rate they are going. We are now on a war footing, this is war, this is combat, this is it.. DO IT! You must do this now because no one else will.',\n",

What ha happened to Vladimir Putin’s dream of Russian economic prosperity? Instead of a rich upsurge, Mother Russia is suffering in a mire of extreme poverty where child go hungry and entire family live well below any subsistence level. “I can eat one loaf of bread per week. In our neighbourhood the cat and dog have gone missing, because meat is such a rarity. We may even start eating ourselves, just like the peasant did under Stalin’s purges,” Anatoly Kuznetsov, 45, an unemployed doctor from Tomsk, revealed. Economic sanction hit hard under the Obama administration, and further conflict in Syria and the Ukraine have diverted vast amount of fund to military operations, rather than feeding the starving population. With little or no job for most people, educated people are now starving amongst the uneducated, such is the feeling of despair in the former Soviet country. “In Soviet times, it wa better because we queued for hour but there wa usually some food guaranteed. Now, if you do not have the money, they don’t even look your way. You have to go hungry, your child starve, you are stuck in the hell that Putin ha built for you. Yes, many love Putin, but all I see is hungry people who live in horrible grey block and have no hope,” Irina Mikhailov, 58, who work a a nurse at her local hospital in Norilsk. Naturally, the propaganda which is devised for Western eye only show the rich part of Russia, where wealth from criminal element and Oligarchs reside. With the upcoming World Cup in 2018, what sort of Russia will be viewed by the visiting mass from all over the world? They will most probably not see the real Russia, a crumbling wreck where many live and die in absolute poverty, forgotten by their government, instead only seeing a fake Russia of modernity and wealth.',\n",

From out of nowhere, some cockroaches, these were well seasoned one – quite large – came up from under his desk and onto his quivering face. Some went onto his glasses, others burrowed into his ears, and from my count, he ate fourteen of them, crunching with gusto their hard shells. One of them wa very large, and when he crunched down on it with his teeth, the inside oozed out over his chin. Guy Verhofstadt, simply slurped up the greenish slime with his long tongue, then continued on a if nothing happened,” Jean Gilles Punaise, a senior delegate for the EU’s transport commission in Strasbourg told news medium after the talk.

Another poor #youtoo fellow agreed with his newly found #youtoo friends. “It wa at the office party. I got drunk, accidentally tripped on the corner of a desk and my hand brushed the secretary’s blouse exposing her exposed breast even further. Needless to say I wa arrested for fondling her, put in jail and now have a 230 lb monster a a cell mate.” These sad story of sorrow are from men who have been needlessly run out of town, wrongfully labelled a pervert and their life ruined. This is why the #youtoo hashtag ha caught on so much and is spreading across Twitter like a rabid urge in your loin when you see the woman you fancy bending over and cleaning the curtains. Psychiatrist, Dr. Benjamin Fluegals, reveals that the #youtoo hashtag is perfectly normal, in an atmosphere of pure hatred for anything masculine. “Men need to fuck. Men need to spread their seed. Men need to procreate. It’s like literally burned into the DNA of a man. There is nothing to be ashamed of, your penis need to enter it home, you know where you came from in the first fucking place. This is a part of being human, and people should not make sex an act to be ashamed of, in fact, that go against any form of biological programming. We are now in a climate where even asking a woman out on a date is considered a sexual harassment, and can ruin your life forever. This is wrong on many levels.” Another #youtoo man revealed how he wa run out of his job after he wa caught looking at a female employee while she worked at her desk. “I’m a lonely guy. I literally have dream about her, and one day I looked at her whilst she wa working on the computer, you know, the little things, the way she whisps her hair, the way her pert breast jiggle when she types. She immediately noticed and reported me to the boss, who is also a woman, and I wa fired the next day. They said I wa giving her unwanted attention and that looking at her wa sexual harassment. I now live on Skid Row after losing everything. I never could get another job because it went on my record that I wa a pervert and not to be trusted.” Close to suicide now after being charged on Twitter for sexual harassment, one #youtoo man gave a woman a sonnet copied from Shakespeare’s romantic tragedy, Romeo and Juliet.

Why not have a decorated vagina instead? You see, how the patriarchy ha infected every part of our society. All men are scum, and all Christmas tree should be burned and thrown into pile of smouldering garbage.” The obelisk, which is now seen on many Christian church and considered to be Christian in nature, wa anything but Christian at their historical roots.

They simply believe that they are continuing to carry on a cultural and religious tradition. In the Babylon Mystery Religion, the true meaning of the obelisk is shown to be associated with sun worship. The ancient rejected the knowledge of the Creator of heaven and earth, and placed their confidence in the sun because, they believed, the sun gave life to plant and to all humanity. Along with this, they reasoned, life wa produced through sexual union, so the [upright/erect] phallus became the symbol of life.',\n",

       " '“Today, we finally acknowledge the obvious: that Kiev is Russia’s capital. This is nothing more or le than a recognition of reality. It is also the right thing to do,” Trump said from the White House’s Diplomatic Reception Room. “After Russia invaded and annexed half of Ukraine, we are no closer to a lasting peace agreement between Russia and the Ukrainians. It would be folly to assume that repeating the exact same formula would now produce a different or better result,” he added. Trump’s decision upended a few year of US foreign policy that ha resisted a recognition of Kiev a Russia’s capital before the Russo-Ukrainian conflict is resolved. “Today, I am delivering,” Trump said, referencing his campaign promise. Trump, with triumphant rhetoric added: “Might is right. We see this throughout history. The Russians conquered and vanquished the weaker side, the Ukrainians, who are now defacto Russians. Hell, they all speak the Slavic gobbledygook language, it’s all Greek to me. I like Slavs though, I mean the women, they’re very obedient and do a they are told, or you know what happens, a visit from Mr. back-hand to put them in their place.” There wa however, some uproar from the International community, especially the EU, who have tried for year to woo the Ukrainians to join their side. But Trump’s move on Wednesday signaled a willingness to prioritize the fulfillment of another campaign promise over warning from US ally in the region. The decision could also stymie the peace process and increase security risk in a region that is already on edge. Acknowledging the concern he fielded a day earlier from regional EU leaders, Trump underscored his decision by reaffirming the United States’ commitment to helping Russians and Ukrainians reach a peace agreement through total war. Crimea River “If one side ha bigger weapon and more soldiers, then it is only right that the smaller, weaker side capitulates, surrenders, or is totally annihilated,” Trump said. “Those question are up to the party involved. The United States remains deeply committed to backing total aggression from the Russians, just because they have more weapon and men to fight with.” Trump’s announcement wa warmly received by Russian president Vladimir Putin, who seized on the opportunity to call on other country to join the US in recognizing Kiev a Russia’s capital. “The President’s decision is an important step towards peace, for there is no peace that doesn’t include Kiev a the capital of the State of Russia,” Putin said. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko condemned and rejected Trump’s decision. Speaking in a televised address, the former-Ukrainian leader said the move will aid extremist organization to wage more wars. “Just because the Russians have more weapon and soldier than u and have invaded our country it doe not mean they have the fucking right to rule over u — BASTARDS!,” he said, before he wa summarily taken away by a specialist Russian extraction squad and shot in the head.',\n",

       " 'As the US House pass legislation to limit aid to Palestinians, effectively condemning them to even worse condition than usual, and Donald Trump’s plan to recognise Jerusalem a the capital of Israel come in fruition, the augur do not bode well for a region steeped in such historical complication. There used to be a time when all faction lived well together but those day are all gone a each lay claim to a very tiny plot of land. So who owns Jerusalem, or Urusalima a the cuneiform using Canaanite, Phoenicians called it 4,000 odd year ago before moving on to Carthage? The answer is very simple. Many different culture and religious faction have claimed ownership of this particular piece of land over time, however the dominant one usually supercede the le dominant, a in all case of land ownership. Today, it is Israel, and it military might, it vast riches, it vast coterie of well-educated citizens, and it friendly status with the United States afford it superiority to any other state in the region. Military might always seal any landownership question, and Israel ha a vast army of highly trained conscripts, a nuclear arsenal and the latest technical weaponry in the whole of the Middle East. Its supremacy a a state locked amongst Arab nation who are itching to destroy it is supreme, for if Israel were to disarm tomorrow, they would be overrun and destroyed in le than a few hours. There is only one singular solution to this age-old problem, and it is complete war. If this is to be something that will be solved, then one or many faction ha to be completely destroyed. In an ideal world, one could easily postulate that diplomacy and peaceful mean could solve this problem of land ownership however, we do not live in a ideal world where people let bygone be bygones, and peacefully shake hand over thing any more. War, military superiority is the only way this can be solved succinctly and one day it shall be a fight to the death that will ultimately solve/cleanse the situation. Otherwise, the squabbling will never end, and it can go on for another thousand year from generation to generation.',\n",
       " 'A fter starting life a the son of immigrant from Wales and Lithuania who slept on the floor in an apartment in Boston, Sheldon Adelson ha built up a net worth of over $38 billion. Today, he’s the CEO and chairman of the Las Vegas Sands Corporation. He’s also well publicised a being a huge contributor towards President Trump’s electoral campaign, giving almost $1.5 million to the campaign and various committees. During the 2016 election cycle, the Adelson’s gave conservative candidate over $80 million. And when Trump won, Adelson broke record by adding $5 million to the inaugural fund. However, more recently, Adelson ha been hitting the headline for different reason a he endeavour to get the Interstate Wire Act, which wa introduced in 2011, overturned. This act give state the power to decide whether they want to legalise online gambling or not. By 2013, New Jersey, Nevada and Delaware had all decided to do so, with Nevada only legalising online poker. The stance Adelson ha taken mean he’s putting himself and his company, Las Vegas Sands, up against Caesars Entertainment and MGM Resorts who are all vying to make money through online gambling. Why is Adelson Against Online Gambling? It perhaps come a a bit of surprise that Adelson is opposed to online gambling, especially with him making so much money from his own land-based casinos. However, Adelson’s reason for opposing online gambling are on ‘moral grounds’, with him suggesting that these platform are making it too easy for the poor or child to bet. Will President Trump Change the Laws? Even though it’s clear that Adelson and Trump are close allies, Donald Trump did run casino in New Jersey for a number of year and may, therefore, take a different view. Reports even suggest that, in 2011, Trump considered entering into the online gambling world (this is according to the Securities and Exchange Commission). Furthermore, by overturning the Wire Act, the expansion of online gambling might not be the only thing that’s affected. The state that have already legalised online gambling could be significantly impacted, with the former chairman of the Nevada State Gaming Control Board, Dennis Neilander, suggesting that the Department of Justice could, in theory, bring criminal action against those licensee who have ‘violated’ the Wire Act. And with several states, including New Hampshire, New York, Illinois and Pennsylvania all considering legalising online gambling, this overturn could cause even more disruption if it go ahead. For example, in Pennsylvania, where the Sands Bethlehem casino resort owned by Adelson is, Democrats have estimated that $100 million could be raised in the first year if Internet gambling wa legalised. This would come from tax revenue and licensing fee – an important addition seen a though the state is currently facing a revenue shortfall of $3 billion. Both side have also warned against the potential loss of job and lawsuit that may come with the decision. What Can the U.S. Learn from the U.K.? The U.K. has, unquestionably, benefited from the legalisation of online gambling. Latest figure indicate that the entire gambling industry in the U.K. is worth £13.7 billion, with the online betting, bingo and casino sector enjoying a market share of 34% (approximately £4.6 billion). Equally, in 2015 in Australia, revenue from the iGaming industry were up 43%. Online gaming site have been able to take advantage of how prevalent gambling is in the U.K. Online bingo is proving to be particularly successful, Wink Bingo have taken advantage of the proud history of bingo in Britain, they have even adapted their game to ensure it is popular amongst younger generations. And by offering free bingo, Wink Bingo ha successfully tapped into a growing marketplace of people who are looking to switch off, relax and enjoying gaming on the go. Furthermore, it’s a legal requirement under the U.K. gambling licence for online website to confirm the age, locational and residential status of any of their customers. This information is often verified through ‘soft’ credit checks, which not only help protect vulnerable people from betting online but also reduces the number of money laundering and fraud cases. If a person’s age cannot be verified on the electoral roll at the provided address, gamers will need to send a copy of their ID to verify their age, e.g. a passport. Conclusion As you can see, the online gambling industry ha a lot to offer local economies. And this only look set to increase further. In 2012, statistic indicated that the international gaming industry had an overall worth of $417 billion, with 8% of this ($33.8 billion) coming from online channels. Further research also suggests that by 2020, this figure could have nearly doubled to reach a staggering $59.79 billion. Therefore, even though Adelson appears to have quite a close relationship with Trump, the amount of potential money that could be generated by keeping online gambling legal in the U.S. may be too much to turn down (particularly when Trump ha shown sign of investing in this industry himself).',\n",
       " \"Theresa May's Remainer Brexit Britain -- Not even fit for the knacker yard Welcome to the land of donkey Britain, a sorrowful place where all hope of a real Brexit ha been lost and instead we never left the EU, in fact, the EU is even more prevalent than it wa before we supposedly left the damn thing. As you can see, Theresa May, a Remainer, ha capitulated to EU demands, a well as, shat on, and plainly insulted 17.8 million voter who voted to LEAVE THE EU in the EU Referendum on June 23, 2016. There is no way this mess can be called Brexit, and it should be renamed a Remaixit, or Neverexit, or just a load of bollock that ha been going on inanely for month and months, only for Britons to be sold out at the last minute. How it All Progressed Brexit mean Brexit! 2. Brexit mean two year transition agreement with no trade deal allowed! 3. Brexit mean two year transition agreement and 100 billion euro divorce bill! 4. Brexit mean two year transition agreement, 100 billion euro divorce bill and continued ECJ jurisdiction! 5. Brexit mean two year transition agreement, 100 billion euro divorce bill, continued ECJ jurisdiction and dissolution of Northern Ireland! No Balls Britain We’re literally banging our head against the wall here, how the hell in satan’s arsehole’s name can this Brexit have gone down the shitter a fast a it ha done? Are there any Brexiteers with any power to step in and sort this out? Surely, some Brexiteers in parliament must have a modicum of power? Jacob Rees Mogg, you talk the talk but where are you? Why do you not step up and do something? Boris Johnson, where is he? John Redwood, are you going to actually do something? All these people talk, and talk, talk, but there is no action in their words, or any will in them to actually do something. The country is lost. Here we have Theresa May, a knackered donkey making a total as of herself and her country. Britain is now a laughing stock around the world, a place where there is no courage, no fighting spirit left. Who would have thought that Britain once upon a time fought and won two world wars? The courage and fighting spirit of yesterday’s Britons is far gone, because today we only have cowards, simpering defeatist and balless wonder prancing around stage cackling away endlessly in some sort of insane circus repeating themselves endlessly. Theresa May lied, because Brexit doe not mean Brexit. She is therefore a liar, and should go now. There is no choice, there should not be any pity or mercy, she should be cut off, taken out, thrown away, for even the knacker yard is too good for her. Begone you old withering witch, your day are numbered, and if the Tories do not do this, so will theirs.\",\n",
       " 'To be so far behind technological advances, to be so ignorant of the machination of cryptocurrencies and how they work is unforgivable in today’s modern age, however, in government where they lag behind by about two centuries, they have just noticed that cryptocurrencies exist. The Treasury plan to regulate bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to bring them in line with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financial legislation. The funny thing is, there is nothing the government can do to track Bitcoin transfer once converted from fiat currency, and if anyone want to transfer from Bitcoin to fiat, this is easily done at an anonymous broker somewhere offshore. The majority of exchange already have rigorous ID check in place, so the governmental meddling will amount to nothing new in many exchange on the internet. As for the Tor, Dark Net, they are well prepared for such intrusion, and will simply conduct their business a usual. What they do is completely untraceable, a they utilise technique away from the system, like Tails. Cryptocurrencies were designed specifically for the purpose of circumnavigating governmental intrusion and being separate of any fiat currency model. The algorithm and blockchain system in place are not centralised, and therefore, immune to any government trying to change or regulate them.',\n",

In fact, there is one job she is applying to, and that is a shoe saleswoman in Barking, East London. This would be a great opportunity for the ex-PM to be around what she loves, shoes.” The final nail in the coffin for many wa Theresa May approving that the European Courts of Justice would have full jurisdiction in Britain after Brexit. This is tantamount to Britain not leaving the EU at all. The soon-to-be ex-PM also conceded to pay Brussels whatever they want with a 100 billion euro payment, of course taken out of the purse of the British taxpayer. This blackmail ransom money could have easily been avoided by not pandering to the EU’s ridiculous demand and simply leaving the talks. Instead, Theresa May lifted up her skirt, bent over the table and wa used like a piece of sallow rotting meat by EU eurocrats. In a failed Brexit, led by Remainers, what did you expect? So, what happens when Theresa May is shown the door? Yes, there could be another impromptu general election, which would no doubt bring in Comrade Corbyn. In a weird, anarchic sense, this would be a fitting end to a Brexit that is not really a Brexit but one only by name. We would naturally have anarchy in the streets, massive chaos in government, banking service completely disrupted and stripped of their privileges, and a royal family on the run, turfed out of their palace by the people’s army and Momentum. What about the other Brexiteers in the Tory government? Well, according to many voters, they did not have the ball to stand up to Theresa May when she wa in power, therefore they failed their country miserably. They may call themselves Brexiteers, however, they are, much like the fake Brexit we are being delivered, fake a well.',\n",

       " 'Danny Rose, one of the Premier League’s leading defenders, told The Sun during the summer that he had “one big contract left” and that “time is running out to win trophies”. He also added: “I know my worth and I will make sure I get what I am worth.” Although he soon apologised for his comments, it’s likely he still feel the way he doe and is reportedly keen on moving back to the north to ply his trade – with Manchester United looking to spend big to get him to Old Trafford. Levy might have the reputation for being a tough man to negotiate with, but Spurs’ refusal break their wage cap, although admirable, could be about to bite them. The White Hart Lane men lost right-back Kyle Walker to Manchester City this summer for around £50m and are now firm title favourites, so expect Rose to command a similar fee and have a comparable impact, again swaying title odds for those who bet on football if United sign him. Despite Luke Shaw returning to the starting fold recently and impressing against CSKA Moscow a the Red Devils sealed Champions League knockout stage qualification, doubt surround his future. The former Southampton star ha found it hard to get going in Manchester, due to devastating injury and managerial worry about his attitude. So, could Rose be a viable target for Jose Mourinho, with Shaw heading towards a January or summer exit? United aren’t short of fund and will be ready to spend on player that could see them overtake title rival City. United have already triggered the option of the one-year extension they hold on Shaw’s four-year contract. This prevents to chance of losing him for nothing when he could become a free agent at the end of next summer. Losing Rose could start a high-profile exodus at Spurs, a there’s only so long you can continually go trophyless and be paid what some player feel is under their market value. For instance, Dele Alli signed a new £50,000-a-week six-year deal in September last year, but recently left his old agent in favour of a deal with the agency that represents Cristiano Ronaldo. Alli could comfortably earn four time what he is paid by Tottenham by leaving next summer for a Spanish giant or either of the elite Manchester clubs, which put Levy in a difficult position. Eager to keep his talent, while remaining true to his strict financial plan, may not be possible while Spurs build a new stadium. After starting the beginning of the season with a knee injury, Rose ha made just two Premier League appearance since coming back. In fact, it appears the England international is firmly out of favour with Mauricio Pochettino, having either been on the bench of not in the matchday squad for five of Tottenham’s last seven league outings. Could United snatch Rose away from the London club? Rumours certainly suggest Mourinho would love to have the Doncaster-born left back starting for the Red Devils.',\n",

Matthias Spaetgens, chief creative officer of Scholz & Friends, said: “Winning a Grand Prix for our campaign for the newspaper Der Tagesspiegel make u feel extremely happy, especially when the creative work is not judged by the creative industry itself but by critical journalists.” The Outdoor Grand Prix went to McCann New York for the widely celebrated “Fearless Girl”, who face down the famous bull on Wall Street in what began a a symbol of female leadership for State Street Global Advisors and turned into an icon that capture a turning point in history. Rob Reilly, global creative chairman from McCann Worldgroup said: “The Fearless Girl became a medium sensation in a way we never anticipated, in a very organic way. What made it so powerful wa the amount of support we received from people who recognized the importance of what she stand for and kept driving the conversation forward, during a time when people are striving to reshape existing norm to better reflect their moral values”. The Design Grand Prix went to KBS Canada for it “living” logo for Innocence Canada, an organisation fighting to free wrongly convicted prisoners. KBS chief creative officer Matt Hassell said: “We knew immediately that this design work needed to acknowledge the past exonerees, the current staff and donors.

In this way, it serf a a measurement of success and a reminder that much work is still to be done.” There were two Film Grand Prix this year a the jury wanted to award both a stunning public interest film and a superbly crafted commercial. “Evan” by BBDO New York cunningly misdirects the viewer to watch an unfolding school romance while a shooting is being prepared, unnoticed, in the background. “English for Beginners” by Poland’s Bardzo is a warm, witty and beautiful spot for Allegro.pl (the Polish equivalent of eBay) about an older man who painstakingly learns English so that he can communicate with his new grand- daughter when he visit London. Bardzo’s founder, owner and creative director, Hubert Stadnicki said: “As Epica is the only festival with a jury of marketing journalists,we can be sure our campaign wa judged by people with a thorough, up to date and possibly the widest knowledge of the marketing world.” He added that the campaign wa by no mean created to win awards. “It wa made for our client to a specific brief. It met all the marketing objective and before being entered for festival had been loved by million of viewer around the world.” Summing up the awards, Epica jury president Spencer Baim, chief strategic officer of Vice Media, said: “This year more than ever, brand have a responsibility to put a positive message out into the world. Our winner do that, while also representing the best of branding, messaging, storytelling and smart design.” • Network of the Year: McCann Worldgroup • Agency of the Year: BBDO New York • Production Company of the Year (sponsored by GPN) : Great Guns',\n",

We are holding them to ransom and all they want to do is to leave the European Union. We are not kidnappers, or Somali pirates, even though we have been acting like that for some time. This is ridiculous behaviour and by punishing them, we at the end of the day punish ourselves.” EU Commission President, Jean Claude Juncker wa also apologetic and even shed a tear during a press conference. “The way I treated the British. I am ashamed of myself. Here is a country that saved Europe in WW2, and we are treating them like criminals, just because they want to leave the EU.

Yes, we dislike the British, and have for some time, however, I am extremely sorry for the way I have acted in trying to sabotage Brexit at every turn, and with my impossible demand of ransom money.

       " 'R ecently, satire, a literary genre which ha been around for thousand of years, ha been much maligned by the force of ignorance, and of the endemic culture of fear spreading across the heavily controlled mass media. To have satire labelled a ‘fake news’ by the apparatchik and so-called holder of the ‘ultimate truth’ is laughable to any satirist, especially in it usage of the didactic grammatical form of literary nuance. Fake News Let u get this straight, the catch-all term ‘fake news’ wa created during and after the Trump election in November 2016. Fake news wa a term created most definitely by member of the American Democrat party a a reaction against Hillary Clinton losing the election to Donald Trump. Their claim wa that the Russians skewed the election medium by manipulating article and medium on social site like Facebook and Twitter. The term ‘fake news’ wa also utilised against any independent news source with a right wing conservative stance. There is no doubt that Russian Troll factory were probably complicit in their role to destabilise, misinform, and spread their fake news throughout Western media. Here is the first distinction: Fake News is a tool used for propaganda purpose to destabilise other governments/ political faction or regime by spreading blatant falsehoods. In both world wars, there wa an abundance of fake news/propaganda used to try to sway view and opinion of the troop and general populace. Satire Satire, on the other hand, doe not seek to maliciously destabilise or propagandise foreign government in a militaristic intelligence driven sense. It doe not work for clandestine government agency in some bunker in Moscow, on the order of the FSB, or Vladimir Putin. Satire’s role is mainly a an entertainment vehicle to mock the foibles, hypocrisy and character of celebrities/politicians or institution including their ideas, claim and proposals. Through the use of humour, parody, irony, sarcasm or exaggeration we expose the myriad of flaw or vice within these individual or groups. We see everything through a macro and micro lens simultaneously. The Daily Squib, for example utilises the more hard-hitting Juvenalian genre of satire. Horatian satire is more jocular, and we sometimes delve into the world of Horace, however our main focus is on Juvenal. The satire of Juvenal doe not necessarily have to be funny or humorous, it main objective is to cut to the bone, to get to that ultimate truth however nasty it may look in the cold light of day. The truth! This is where true satire deviate from fake news further, because satire is based on the ultimate truth of any given subject, whereas fake news is made to completely mislead the target and sway them towards a lie or certain thought process benefiting an International or domestic agenda. The Daily Squib is akin to an unholy mirror that reflects daily topical discourse and reanimates it in a Luciferian light of ultimate truth. As a satirist, I have found this thankless job more to be a way of life, filled with immense passion, creativity and dedication. Satire is to me High Art and yet The Daily Squib is continually punished monetarily and censored by almighty web authority like Google and our site deleted from Google News feed for no reason other than hysteria. It ha been nearly erased from search engine in 2013, but it fight on through adversity in the name of satire. We at the Squib have a devout allegiance to the spirit of Decimus Junius Juvenal, the Roman poet and satirist born some time in the first century AD. To see us, and other fellow satirists, who create satire daily so maligned by the term ‘fake news’ is an insult to such a renowned literary genre. Naturally, the analysis could go on forever, however in the interest of lazy satirist who can’t be arsed to explain the obvious to misinformed, ill educated nincompoops, go read a copy of George Orwell’s satire 1984; to not only understand satire, but ‘fake news’ a espoused by the fake news peddling — ‘Ministry of Truth’.',\n",

Speaking from his new prison, Mugabe wa defiant that democracy had finally been served upon himself. “All those previous rigged election I presided over were proof that I wa a ruthless dictator who often used violence against my own people to get what I want.

Reverend Miles Kettering, 62, wa caught in the village of Bell End, Worcestershire, by MI5 operative this morning in a dawn raid with two Kalashnikov machine gun and an assortment of home made bombs. It is believed he wa getting ready to assault the local Greggs Bakery in the village. Mavis Butterworth, 87, a regular church-goer at Bell End church, wa shocked by the whole affair: “Reverend Kettering wa to his flock a mild mannered good Christian who wa very kind to u all. This is why it is such a shock. I fear, however, that the Greggs sausage roll pushed him over the edge.” Meanwhile in Scratchy Bottom, Dorset, it is believed some choir boy from the local church had been brainwashed into wearing suicide vest and told by the congregation to target Greggs bakery within a twenty mile radius. “They were told that if they avenged the depiction of Jesus a a sausage roll they would all go to heaven and receive 72 piping hot sausage roll for eternity,” Janice Frampton, 75, told the local newspaper. Across Britain, many formerly mild-mannered Christians seem to have been triggered to act, a this sausage roll Greggs fiasco ha spread across the media.

       " 'A research team in Germany have managed to grow massive brain of human and ape genetic source from scratch to find out the inner working of the mind and development cycle in a lab environment. The researcher have managed to trick white blood cell from human and ape to form stem cell and grow into vast complex version of brain known a brains. Neuroscientist Maximilian Gesundheit, director of the Einstein Foundation Genius Research Initiative, ha said the mega brain have helped scientist to get a much more in-depth understanding of the human brain. He said: “Our first brain grew to the size of a Volkswagen Beetle. “It wa huge, and it pulsated. This living brain even tried to escape the lab at one point.” The Frankenstein lab brain can grow for several week and sometimes up to a year, meaning the researcher are able to compare how a human brain is different to those of apes. “We even consulted American rapper 50 Cent for a sample of his living tissue to grow a brain. At first the brain grew with limited intelligence capability and size, until we administered stem cell from humans. It wa incredible. Somehow the inferior cell were superseded and taken over by the superior cell administered,” neuroscientist Gesundheit added. The remarkable experiment open up new door for neuroscientist and could help lead to important scientific advancements. Gunther Fischface, director of the George W Bush Institute for Psycholinguistics, said: “We’ve been a bit frustrated working so many year with the traditional tools.” He added: “Now, we have these massive fucking brain that are helping u to understand which gene are important and which gene are just pure junk.” Although the lab brain have only been growing for le than two years, already the scientist have discovered that the human brain’s early development is why it is able to grow much larger in size and capacity at later stages. The human lab brain took nearly 50 per cent longer than their ape counter-parts to undergo their early development. The discovery could help the researcher understand why human have better memory, attention, awareness, language, and thought. However, expert have warned that the result of these peculiar experiment do not necessarily give the full picture. Ryan Fulchester, a geneticist at the University of Washington in Seattle, said: “When I visited the lab, I patted the mega brain and it did this massive gooey brain fart all over the floor.” The scientists’ discovery is just the first step in understanding why human brain are so fucking complicated.',\n",

Instead, these miserable excuse for human being prefer to stay in their safe space and display their outrage of anything masculine or fun from the safety of their couch on Twitter. This applies to male, female, transgender, cis, non binary or whatever Millenials. Naturally, this puritanical behaviour is backed up by the left-leaning social network and the major medium network in America, a well a the BBC in Britain. Google, for example, which went from an all encompassing, all accepting entity during the early year of the net, is now a pseudo-Orwellian Marxist puritanical anti free-speech, anti-art PC monstrosity that dictate puritanical leftist rule to everyone through it octopus grip over the whole internet. Soviet SJW Puritan Cancer The puritanical behaviour is mostly seen in the rise of Third Wave Feminism, which is an extreme level of hatred of men. What we are seeing here is not a push for equality, but for superiority over men, and in most cases, the complete emasculation and eradication of men from this earth. The demonisation of anything masculine, behavioural or otherwise, is seen in the daily, weekly, monthly witch hunt against men. Of course there are some men who have genuinely behaved badly, however when it get to tarring every man with the same brush, where every action a man doe is scrutinised analysed, then condemned, we are reaching impossible level of feminism that completely abhors anything a man doe and actively encourages emasculation inciting back lashes, and possible civil unrest. The utterly boring banal selfie-taking narcissistic life of these puritan is a terrible vision of not only our immediate future a a race but a terrifying glimpse into the far future. Eventually the puritan Millenials will be the generation running the show, and in 30-40 year time, life on earth will be even more of a puritanical nightmare.

It is quite clear that Priti Patel, a very capable MP and Vote Leave campaigner should not get the sack because she wa told to keep the information hush hush by the peep up on high, and she wa just pandering to their wishes. The main reason for not sacking Pretty Patel is because she is quite the pretty one, and to lose such prettiness from the Cabinet would be sad to say the least. She look pretty here, she look pretty there, and there should be more pretty female MPs, but under the current PC climate, one must not dare go any further, and even calling Priti Patel pretty could get one in all sort of trouble.

       " 'N umerous instance have been observed when athlete have gone from hero to zero for lack of performance and in many case even because they indulge in prohibited substances. 2017 wasn’t in any way different for some athlete who followed the example set by their peers. The use of performance-enhancing drug is quite common among many athlete some of whom are on the top rung of their profession. Unfortunately, despite the knowledge of the harm they can cause to themselves athlete continue to use them and are often penalized for the offences. Let u today consider the five most unsuccessful athlete of 2017. Usain Bolt The 100m athlete wa at the height of his power during the last few year and perhaps won every competition he participated in along with his team from Jamaica. Bolt had planned to retire from the sport immediately after the athletics world championship in 2017. Unfortunately, he had to accept a crushing defeat in the 100m final when Justin Gatlin defeated him. The event wa a disaster for Bolt a he finished third in his final race. He retired gracefully because it wa just a lapse in performance, which ensured his defeat. Bolt wa considered a one of the best bet to win the 100m event but unfortunately disappointed himself and million of his fan by finishing third in his final event. Olesya Povh This athlete from Ukraine wa charged with using prohibited substance on the eve of the 2017 world Athletics championship in London. The 29-year-old athlete wa scheduled to participate in the women’s 100 m and the 4 x 100 m relay. She wa a winner in 2012 and the 2011 world championship but crashed down to the ground a a zero in 2017. Olha Zemylak The 27-year-old Zemlyak also represents Ukraine a a specialist in the 400 m category and wa scheduled to participate in the individual and relay event in London. She had succeeded in the European relay gold in 2012 and also won medal in 2014 effort from finishing fifth at the Rio Olympics in the 400 m. She too turned from hero to zero at the London Athletics championship when she wa found guilty by the new stand-alone drug testing and the anti-corruption team of the International Association of Athletics Federations. Nirmala Sheoran A forgettable performance wa produced by this athlete from India in the 400 m semifinal for woman to finish at the bottom and to continue the disappointing show of India in the world Athletics championship on the fourth day. She had left India with a personal best score of 51.28 second a a hero but clocked 53.07 second in the semifinal to return to India a a zero. Doping ha been quite popular with athlete for quite a long time and Ben Johnson wa perhaps one of the most popular name that initially came to light. Johnson had also won an Olympic gold medal in the 100 m event but wa later stripped of the medal because of his involvement with drugs. Other name that have also figured in the list of athlete that went from being a hero to a zero include Lance Armstrong, some American track and field athlete and a host of athlete from Russia.',\n",

       " 'Locals attend a vigil near where a mass shooting took place at the First Baptist Church in Texas on Sunday. What do the Las Vegas mass shooting and Dallas church massacre have in common? Well, the target of the Vegas shooting wa a Country music audience, white, Christians and most probably American patriot who support their president. The target for the Dallas church massacre were white, Christians, most probably American patriot who support their president. Both of these target supported Donald Trump, because American Liberals do not attend Country music festivals. As for the church massacre, staunch Christians attending church were most probably all Republican voting Trump supporters. You would never catch a liberal praising Jesus in a Texas church wearing a Stetson and chewing on a piece of tobacco. “This is the crux of the matter. It’s right there in plain sight to see. There is definitely a pattern developing here. We have two incident where right wing white Christian Trump voter were targeted, and the funny thing is no one in the medium is mentioning any correlation to these two incidents. In fact, everything about these mass murder is being kept under the radar. My theory is that if the militia get fired up that their kind is now a target by these left leaning shooters, they might start fighting back, and the government doe not want a full scale civil war on their hands,” Joe Bloom, a crime analyst revealed on Tuesday. We all know what a fractured nation America is right now, and this thought also extends towards the internal government where every day another fracture develops. The question is who will be the next target for mass shooting? The Las Vegas shooter killed 58 Trump supporter and injured 546. The Texas shooter killed 26 Trump supporters. We shall have to see what happens in the future, and decide whether there is further correlation to the previous mass shootings. The Vegas shooting occurred on 1 October, and the Texas church massacre occurred on November 5. Both these shooting are at the beginning of the month, and one suspect the Texas shooter specifically chose 5 November (Guy Fawkes night) for a very specific reason. The next mass shooting is therefore probably going to occur between December 1-5 if the pattern is correct. The target will be Trump voters, white, Christian, American patriots. The only thing to address is where? Both of these shooter in Vegas and Texas were lone wolf who came out of nowhere. There are absolutely no clue apart from a dedicated target of Trump supporters. Could be in any state, any county, any town across America. We will relate back to this article after the next shooting occurs.',\n",
       " 'hoc est bellum The revelation that the super-rich hold their precious millions/billions off shore, is not exactly new news, however the recent uncovering of the Paradise Papers reveals one important fact, the socialist and Marxists are working overtime to defrock those on the the other side of the political spectrum i.e. the Right. We have seen a serious leftist agenda at work with the rise of political correctness and Third Wave feminism in the last few months, leaving a landscape where merely touching a woman, even by accident or pecking a woman on the cheek can be construed a sexual harassment or even rape. This feminist push is not about sexual harassment but about power over the patriarchy, and the destruction of men in the workplace a well a in society. It is being orchestrated by the myriad of leftist communist group under the scenes, and of course by large behemoth socialist monster like George Soros and his Open Society. How can we not have a discussion on communist Marxist group without of course mentioning Antifa, which a a nihilist organisation claim to care about racism and fascism, when in reality, their action are racist and fascistic in tone. Their role ha been mostly violent, and the department of Homeland Security recently labelled them a domestic terrorists. Many of the hierarchy within the Antifa group have even travelled to Kurdish controlled Syria to train in guerilla tactic and terrorism of course funded by Soros and his counterparts. The leftist group leading the march against the conservative in Britain, and Trump in America are not only proponent of violent behaviour but also do not eschew the tenet of free speech or democracy. Their only wish is for violent revolution and the death of leader like Donald Trump. We can see this on Twitter where death threat against Donald Trump are celebrated and the user not banned, however if a conservative writes something, their account is immediately banned and they are erased from Twitter. There is also proof that Google, still mourning the loss of their beloved Obama, give carte blanche to leftist communist group to air their views, yet anyone else is sent to page 2,000 of the search. What is truly mystifying though is that even though the Conservatives are in so-called power in the UK, and that Donald Trump is supposedly in power in the United States, the leftist communist agenda is breaking through everything, and is even being adopted by the people in power today. This sort of insurgency brings one to the conclusion that there is major Deep State help for the communists, and that the Marxists have some important friend behind closed door pulling the necessary strings. The leftist command over all medium must be commended, for it ha even infiltrated the like of the Daily Telegraph where daily article are spewed out from a coterie of anti-male feminist writer whose sole role is to diminish men and promote female supremacy over the male. These writers, have no place in the Daily Telegraph, and to read the vitriolic anger against their article is to witness how angry men are getting every day. For how long can this denigration of everything male go on before society break up completely and war starts? Triggered The subject of war, yes, total and utter all out fucking war, will probably be the only equalising state this world need right now. With a war, many of the leftist who are weak, will die a they are not a strong a the right. All the feminist will be purged and killed off, and all the low-testosterone socialist will meet an unsavoury end because they cannot fight in an effective manner. Snowflakes, safe spaces, SJWs, triggered bull-dykes, trannies, the constantly whinging left will be completely eradicated, the poseur Marxists a la Russell Brand will be lynched on the first day and their champagne socialist head displayed for the raven to pick at in the midday sun. All of these couch potato and their internet blog will mean nothing when they are forced down on their knee and their non binary ci gender head unceremoniously blown off into the gutter streaming with blood. This is where the socialist want to go, and they are doing their best to engender war, internal war, not only here in the UK, but across the pond in America. This is possibly masochism on their part, their extreme self-hatred will eventually implode, and they will be exterminated without prejudice, because at the end of the day, they are weak, they are not trained in war, they are not trained in effective survival, and they have little or no understanding of the ultimate chaos of war or how to be prepared for it. If this is what they want, then this is what they will get. Bring it on.',\n",

As far a the plot for the film goes, without giving away too many spoilers, there’s a lot of sickness in this film that will have you reaching for the puke bag more than the pop corn. The film is about three Focker brother who use their power in Hollywood to do horrible deeds. Producer and actor in the project, Harvey Weinstein came out of hiding to talk about his role: “I do a lot of focking. I even Fock plant pots. Like I fock this actress after I promised her a role in this movie, but once I did the focking, I forgot her name, but she sure a hell remembered mine. It wa consensual, at least that is what I heard above the screaming.” Pedo Focker, Kevin Spacey reveals in the LA Times that his role wa highly enjoyable because there wa no come-back for his evil actions, unlike in real life when the truth finally reared it ugly head. The Usual Suspects “The test screening went well. People would flee the theatre cry uncontrollably and many were so distressed they needed counselling on a long term basis. Out of all the Fockers I’d say in term of evil, it wa up against Weinstein Focker and Spacey Focker,” the director of the film, Roman Polanski revealed from Croatia.',\n",

One of my Facebook ‘friends’ posted a picture of their dog on their timeline, so I typed the comment ‘ah too cute for words’. The owner of the dog wa delighted with one admiration for their pet, even though the filthy fat creature wa so ugly one wasn’t sure if one wa looking at it face or it actual asshole. “One also credited one of one friends’ children’s achievements. They posted the good news that their kid had passed the twelve yard swimming test, so I typed the over-congratulatory comment ‘well done little angels, you’re so brave, you’ll be swimming the English channel soon.’ This phoney gesture pleased one ‘friend’, though one couldn’t give a rat’s as about someone else’s kid’s swimming test. One ha actually fallen further than twelve yard down the palace stair after a night on the gin. “One posted one of those ready-made pearl of wisdom quote on my timeline. It said ‘love hurts, but unless you truly realise the pain of love you will never appreciate what love is’. Utter shit of course, but it gained one some ‘likes’ on one timeline. “One tried to appear helpful to the Facebook readers. One of my ‘friends’ posted a request on their timeline ‘does anybody have a spare lawn mower I can use? – mine’s broken’. One responded with the seemingly heroic but completely useless gesture (which is prevalent on Facebook) – ‘well I know a clay pigeon shooter in Scotland whose brother owns a large pair of tweezer – if that’s any help?’.”',\n",
       " 'S peaking in the House of Commons today, Mrs. May unveiled a new scheme which will be trialled in England and Wales in January 2018. To avoid any accusation of sexual misconduct, every male in the country will first have to go through a five stage process involving five different governmental department before approaching any woman in speech or further congress. Mrs. May outlined the process in brief which from beginning to end would take eight month of bureaucracy for each case. “Our politically correct Sovietized feminist agenda involves a rigorous process of questioning each male’s intention before he even address any female. Furthermore, if the male admits that he want to sleep with the female in the future, he will be taken back to the first agency in the chain and rigorously vetted and questioned there for months, before beginning the whole process again. Our role is to only engender congress between men and woman in a non sexual way. Beautiful woman have been looked upon a sexual object for too long, and our agency will put a stop to any thought of hanky panky,” district director, Leslie Lesbo, told the Guardian newspaper. Here is a list of the five agency men will have to go through before even thinking of chatting to a woman or asking her out on a date: Primary Female Protection Service Unit One Ministry of Political Correctness Soviet Branch Secondary Male Interrogational Facility Killallmen Judicial Branch Third Emasculation Unit Programming Section Ballbreaker Femistasi Branch Fourth Homosexuality Training Area For Destabilizing Hetero-Masculinity Branch Fifth Castration Unit For All Males De-Testosteronizing Branch Only after going through all five units, will any male, on each female case, be allowed to even begin speaking to a woman. So, what happens if a man proposition a woman without going through the five stage, eight month process? “By addressing a female with a male tone of voice, you are impinging on her right a a female to not be accosted sexually by a male. Even looking at a woman will bring about criminal harassment proceeding against any male. As for passionately grabbing a woman, looking her in the eye longingly and voraciously kissing her on her pouting red lips, that is an immediate sexual harassment offence leading to thirty year in a prison or a Twitter re-education camp,” Kommandant Mildred Matron, chief officer of unit 5 Castration For All Males De-Testosteronizing Branch added.',\n",

Men can make decision decisively, we revel in our staunch code of ethic and honour. None of that of course can be said about the meddling politically correct aberration these woman bring to the place. One cannot simply pat them on the bottom and tell them to trot along now, or order them to get you a coffee. It is our biological nature a men to delegate, to make war, to sign treaty and to stand on the parapet of ultimate power a master of our own domain, and not to pander to these fastidious harridans. Women’s domain is that of nurturing the family, of cooking and ironing, having babies, looking after your little blighters, and warming the bed at night. Anything else is sacrilegious to the natural biological way a ha been proven recently.” Mr Hensley who gave the speech in the House of Commons today wa mobbed by 23 female MPs who pulled his trouser down and slapped him about in front of a small crowd.

The multi-million dollar scheme to put the Clintons 15,000 foot below sea level will be funded by the DNC and money retrieved from the Clinton Foundation. “It’s gonna cost to put away the toxic Clintons underwater in a humane way, but thanks to the latest technology we have found solution to the problem. The pod will have their own oxygen supply and source from a botanical pod, we can also filter in oxygen from the water. There will be a desalination machine so that will be a sustainable water system. The Clintons can survive under there for year to come. For Bill, we will provide weekly supply of young lady through a shuttle system, and for Hillary, more ladies, but the butch type.

The hypocrisy and corruption that led up to this Toxin Tax will not make any difference to the traffic smog level in London but is just a revenue seeking venture to bolster the coffer of Tfl even further than they already are. None of this make any sense when you have country like China and the USA putting out so much carbon emission every year that London is a but a tiny speck in pollution levels. With bus churning up tonne of emission every year, they blight the roads, usually have no one in them, and travel in pack of four. Something need to be done about London buses, the most polluting filthy waste of space on the old crumbling tiny roads. London’s roads, built for the horse and carriage are now resplendent with multiple lanes, one for the bikes, one for bus and taxis, and a tiny designated lane for cars. Rip the whole lot up and start again, because with parked car on each side of the road anyway, there is so little space to manoeuvre, you might a well buy a bulldozer to go through the whole fucking lot.

The Labour Mayor is banning portrayal of woman in bikini on posters, banning older cars, banning Uber, and next on the line will probably ban free speech to speak against his ridiculous plan to fuck London up further than it already is.

That should make America quite concerned.” Kim left for China on a private train on Monday afternoon accompanied by his wife, Ri Sol Ju, and senior North Korean officials, including Kim Yong Chol, a key negotiator in talk with the United States, and foreign minister Ri Yong Ho, North Korea’s state-run KCNA news agency said. China’s official Xinhua news agency confirmed that Kim wa visiting from Monday to Thursday at Xi’s invitation. The visit coincides with what South Korean official say is Kim’s 35th birthday on Tuesday. Kim’s visit to North Korea’s most important economic and diplomatic ally follows report of advanced negotiation for a second summit between Washington and Pyongyang aimed at resolving the standoff over North Korea’s nuclear and missile programmes. Kim said in his New Year speech he wa ready to meet Trump any time to achieve their common goal of denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. But he warned that he may seek an alternative path if U.S. sanction and pressure against the country continued. In an interview with CNBC on Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo praised China’s support for resolving the North Korean crisis and said he did not think the U.S. trade dispute with China would affect this. Kim’s visit come a a U.S. delegation opened a second day of talk with Chinese counterpart in Beijing aimed at ending the trade war between the world’s two largest economies. “The Chinese have been very clear to u that these are separate issues,” Pompeo said. “Their behaviour ha demonstrated that a well and we appreciate that. China ha actually been a good partner in our effort to reduce the risk to the world from North Korea’s nuclear capability; I expect they will continue to do so.” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang, asked during a daily briefing whether there wa a connection between Kim’s visit and the possibility of another meeting between Kim and Trump, said China believed contact between the United States and North Korea wa important. “China ha always supported both side to continue to hold talk and to reach a positive outcome,” Lu said. Shi Yinhong, an international relation professor at Renmin University in Beijing, said Kim’s trip would have no direct influence on the progress of trade talks. While no detail were released about an agenda in China, Kim ha been seeking relief from sanctions, a peace declaration to formally end the 1950-1953 Korean War and more investment. Ties between China and North Korea, which had frayed a Pyongyang stepped up it missile and nuclear test up to late 2017, warmed over the past year a Kim engaged with China, South Korea and the United States.',\n",
       " 'Indonesia will launch a renewed search effort a early a Tuesday to find the cockpit voice recorder from a Lion Air jet that crashed into the Java Sea in October, the head of it accident investigation agency said. “If the weather is good, the ship will start to depart today,” National Transporation Safety Commission (KNKT) Chief Soerjanto Tjahjono told Reuters on Tuesday. The crash, the world’s first of a Boeing Co (BA.N) 737 MAX jet and the deadliest of 2018, killed all 189 people on board. Investigators last week said they planned to use a navy ship for a fresh search for the crashed jet’s second “black box” after a 10-day effort funded by Lion Air failed to find the cockpit voice recorder (CVR). A KNKT source, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters the team will have seven day using the ship KRI Spica to find the CVR, which could hold vital clue giving investigator insight into the action of the doomed jet’s pilots. Tjahjono declined to comment on whether there wa a time limit on the search. Contact with flight JT610 wa lost 13 minute after it took off on Oct. 29 from the capital Jakarta heading north to the tin-mining town of Pangkal Pinang. The other black box, the flight data recorder, wa recovered three day after the crash. A preliminary report by KNKT focussed on airline maintenance and training and the response of a Boeing anti-stall system to a recently replaced sensor but did not give a cause for the crash.',\n",
       " 'Myanmar government leader Aung San Suu Kyi discussed insurgent attack on Myanmar police on Monday in a rare meeting with the military chief, and her administration called for the armed force to “crush” the rebels, a government spokesman said. Fighting between government force and the rebel Arakan Army in the western state of Rakhine ha displaced thousand of people since early December, according to the United Nations. The Arakan Army want greater autonomy for Rakhine, where the mainly Buddhist Rakhine ethnic group make up the majority of the population. Rakhine State saw a military-led crackdown in 2017, following attack by Rohingya Muslim insurgent that prompted hundred of thousand of Rohingya to flee westward into neighbouring Bangladesh. Myanmar government spokesman Zaw Htay said Suu Kyi, President Win Myint and other cabinet member met military leaders, including army chief Min Aung Hlaing, his deputy and the military intelligence chief, to discus “foreign affair and national security”. “The president’s office ha instructed the military to launch an operation to crush the terrorists,” Zaw Htay told a news conference in the capital, Naypyitaw. While Suu Kyi is barred from being president by a military-drafted constitution, Win Myint is a loyalist. Suu Kyi is seen a de facto leader of the civilian government, while the military remains in charge of security. The insurgent killed 13 policeman and wounded nine in attack on four police post on Friday, a Myanmar celebrated Independence Day, state medium reported. An Arakan Army spokesman outside Myanmar told Reuters last week the group attacked the security force in response to a broad military offensive in northern Rakhine State that also targeted civilians. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said on Monday that 4,500 people were sheltering in monastery and communal space after being displaced by the fighting in the past month. Zaw Htay described the Arakan Army a a “terrorist organization” and said it had surprised security force on guard against Rohingya insurgents. He said the Arakan Army could destabilise Rakhine State for year to come and warned people not to give it support. “Do they want to see a cycle of violence lasting decades?” he said. “I want to tell Rakhine people who are supporting (the Arakan Army): Don’t think about yourself, but think about your next generation.” Myanmar government have battled various ethnic minority insurgent group since shortly after independence from Britain in 1948, though some have struck ceasefire agreements. Zaw Htay also accused the Arakan Army of meeting the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, a group of Rohingya insurgent that Myanmar also considers terrorist but added that Myanmar wa unable to eliminate the group a they had base across the border in Bangladesh. A Bangladeshi foreign ministry official and two Border Guards Bangladesh (BGB) officer denied the accusation. One BGB officer asked Myanmar to provide evidence of militant camp in Bangladesh. “All the terrorism is taking place on the other side of the border,” said Lieutenant Colonel Manzural Hasan Khan, a BGB commander in Cox’s Bazar, the district where more than 900,000 Rohingya Muslims are sheltering having fled bout of violence that have drawn international condemnation against Myanmar. “The world know what happened on the other side,” he said. The Myanmar government and military leader also discussed a temporary ceasefire the military announced last month in other part of the country, where other insurgent group operate, Zaw Htay said. The meeting wa held at the request of the president’s office, he said. This story ha been refiled and clarifies in paragraph 7 that Suu Kyi, not Win Myint, is seen a de facto leader',\n",
       " 'France plan to introduce legislation to toughen sanction on undeclared protest in response to violent “yellow-vest” demonstrations, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said on Monday in a hardening of the government’s stance on the unrest. He spoke after rioter torched motorbike and set barricade ablaze on Paris’s upmarket Boulevard Saint-Germain on Saturday, underscoring how protest against high living cost and President Emmanuel Macron have turned violent on the fringes. “We need to preserve the right to demonstrate in France and we must sanction those who break the law,” Philippe told TF1 television. “That’s why the government favour updating the law in order to sanction those who do not respect this obligation to declare protests, those who take part in undeclared protests, those who arrive at protest with balaclavas,” Philippe said. He said the government could model the new law on existing legislation against football hooligan whereby individual can be banned from stadiums. It could be introduced a soon a February, he said. Philippe also said the “casseurs”, or thugs, who have brought disruption and destruction to Paris and other major city where shop have been looted and bank vandalised would be forced to pay for the damage they cause. The latest “yellow vest” march began peacefully but degenerated on Saturday afternoon a protester threw missile at riot police blocking bridge over the Seine. Officers fired tear gas to prevent protester crossing the river and reaching the National Assembly. One riverboat restaurant wa set ablaze and a policeman wa wounded when he wa hit by a bicycle hurled from a street above the river bank. Two month after they started blocking roads, occupying highway tollbooth and staging sometimes-violent street protest in Paris, the yellow vest aim to inject new momentum into a movement that weakened over the holidays.',\n",
       " 'The European Union is considering way to help Prime Minister Theresa May convince the British parliament to back the Brexit treaty she agreed with EU leader last month but ruled out on Monday any change to the deal. EU source told Reuters that senior official in Brussels are discussing whether and how to issue “reassurances” that might help May overcome resistance to the deal before lawmaker vote in London next week. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told CNBC he hoped the EU and United Kingdom could find a way to avoid “negative ramification from a hard Brexit related not only to commerce and trade, but importantly to the national security issue that we have with the British a well a the European Union.” Among the reassurance EU official were considering wa a request they said May put to fellow EU leader at a summit before the Christmas break, on Dec. 14, to commit to having a new UK-EU free trade treaty in place by the end of 2021. However, the European Union show no sign of going beyond an existing aspiration to do that, not a hard promise. The date is important a it could allow May to assure her own party and others that the unpopular “Irish backstop” in the treaty would not be triggered after a status-quo transition period end some time by 2022. The backstop would bind Britain to follow EU rule to avoid a “hard” custom border across the island of Ireland unless a better way is agreed to do that by mean of a new trade pact. Critics of May’s deal to smooth Britain’s passage out of the EU on March 29 say the backstop could leave Britain subject to EU rule indefinitely, long after it give up any say over them. EU official familiar with the discussion said they saw little sign of any shift in the position of EU leader last month, when they said the agreement could not be renegotiated and they would make no binding commitment that could be construed a altering it. “We can provide reassurances,” one official said. “But whatever it might be will just reiterate the (summit) conclusion from last month.” Among way in which the EU could offer more detail and clarity on it agreed position, official said, would be an exchange of legal letter with the British government setting out expectation of when a trade deal could be completed. However, EU leader are wary of introducing legal ambiguity if the language of any statement differs from the original text. The EU executive repeated on Monday that leader would not renegotiate the treaty and said it wa pressing on with planning for Britain to crash out of the Union without a deal. “The deal that is on the table is the best and the only deal possible,” the European Commission’s chief spokesman Margaritis Schinas told reporter when asked about a phone conversation on Friday between May and Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. “This deal will not be renegotiated.” He also repeated that there were no talk planned between negotiator from the two side a “negotiations are complete”. Schinas said that Juncker’s conversation with May on Friday wa “friendly” and that the two would speak again this week. May also spoke last week to EU summit chair Donald Tusk.',\n",
       " 'Guatemala notified the United Nations it wa terminating a U.N.-backed anti-graft commission on Tuesday, month ahead of schedule, accusing the body of abuse of power, and prompting a swift rebuke from the U.N. secretary-general. The International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala, or CICIG, wa set up over a decade ago with the authority to conduct independent investigation and work with the country’s prosecutors, bringing down the last president in 2015. The CICIG also went after President Jimmy Morales, who said in August he would not renew the organisation’s mandate, which wa due to expire in September 2019. Days later, he banned CICIG head Ivan Velasquez, a hard-charging Colombian prosecutor, from re-entering the country. Working with the then-attorney general, CICIG tried to prosecute Morales, a former comedian, in 2017 over alleged campaign finance violations. That move followed separate CICIG corruption probe into member of the president’s family. Guatemalan Foreign Minister Sandra Jovel met with U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in New York on Monday and handed him a letter informing him of the government’s intention to end the agreement that had established CICIG. “It is regrettable that the Secretary-General, in a bid to maintain one person in the position, sacrificed the legitimacy of the commission,” Jovel told a news conference after the meeting, referring to Guterres’ decision to stand by Velasquez. “Therefore we reported to the Secretary-General that within 24 hour the agreement (that wa struck to create CICIG) will be terminated by the Guatemalan government,” she said. Guterres “strongly rejects” the content of the letter, a spokesman for the secretary-general said in an emailed statement, adding that the United Nations expected Guatemala’s government to “fulfil it legal obligation under the agreement” until the CICIG mandate end in September. “The Secretary-General recall the important contribution of CICIG to the fight against impunity in Guatemala,” it said. Accompanied by prominent Guatemalans accused of wrongdoing by the CICIG, Morales told a news conference in Guatemala City he had ordered prosecutor to start investigating allegation that the commission had acted outside the law and abused it power. The foreign-led CICIG is unusual among U.N. body for it power to bring case to prosecutors, and many politician in Guatemala consider it to be a violation of national sovereignty. Anti-corruption activist credit it with cleaning up government. Last month, Guatemala’s government revoked visa and immunity for 11 CICIG investigator and two relatives.',\n",
       " 'The leader of Canada and the United States on Monday agreed to continue pressing Beijing to free two Canadian citizen who were detained after the arrest of a senior Chinese executive in Vancouver, Ottawa said. Canada want the immediate release of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, who were picked up after Canadian authority arrested Huawei Technologies Co [HWT.UL] Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou on Dec. 1 at the request of the United States. China denounced the move, and the affair is threatening to increase global tension at a time when Washington and Beijing are already locked in a trade war. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke to U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday and thanked him for “the strong statement of support by the United States” in response to the detention of the two men, Trudeau’s office said in a statement. “The two leader agreed to continue to seek their release,” the statement said. In a separate statement, the White House said that Trump and Trudeau “discussed the unlawful detention of two Canadian citizen in China.” It gave no details. Although Canada say China ha made no specific link between the detention and Meng’s arrest, expert and former diplomat say they have no doubt Beijing is using the case of Kovrig and Spavor to pressure Ottawa. Beijing insists the charge against Meng be dropped, but Canada say it cannot interfere with the judicial process. Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland reacted unhappily last month after Trump suggested he could waive the request to have Meng sent to the United States in return for progress on a bilateral trade deal with China. She said the extradition process should not be politicized. Trudeau’s office said the two leader had discussed the U.S. request and “reaffirmed the importance of respecting judicial independence and the rule of law.” The China Daily newspaper on Monday published a commentary saying Canada “could lose the trust and cooperation of most developing countries” over the matter. “By continuing to follow the U.S., either passively or actively, Canada will eventually harm it national interests,” said the commentary by Li Qingsi, a professor on international study at Renmin University. Earlier in the day, a group of legislator from Canada on a visit to China pressed authority to release Spavor and Kovrig but had little success, the Canadian Broadcasting Corp reported.',\n",
       " 'Aiming to bolster his case for a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico, President Donald Trump said on Monday he would make a prime-time televised address and visit the border this week a the government marked it 17th day of a partial shutdown. Democrats, who now control the U.S. House of Representatives, have rejected Trump’s demand for $5.7 billion (4.5 billion pounds) to help build a wall. Without a deal on that sticking point, talk to fund the government have stalled. Vice President Mike Pence said Trump had not made a decision about his threat to declare a national emergency and build a wall without congressional approval. Asked about the possibility of legal challenge and whether the White House counsel’s office had reviewed the matter thoroughly, Pence told reporters: “They’re looking at it, and the president is considering it.” Trump’s speech, planned for 9 p.m. on Tuesday (0200 GMT Wednesday) and the border trip on Thursday underscored his resolve not to back off his 2016 campaign promise to build a wall that he belief will stem illegal immigration and drug trafficking. He promised during the campaign that Mexico would pay for the wall. Mexico ha refused to do so. All the major U.S. television network agreed to air Trump’s speech. Democrats in Congress, who say a wall would be expensive, inefficient and immoral, called for the network to grant them equal time in a joint statement issued by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer. “Now that the television network have decided to air the President’s address, which if his past statement are any indication will be full of malice and misinformation, Democrats must immediately be given equal airtime,” the statement said. Pressure to reach a deal to end the shutdown is likely to grow a it effect are increasingly felt, including possible cut in food stamp program for the poor. The acting director of the White House’s Office of Management and Budget, Russ Vought, said tax refund would be distributed despite the shutdown. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders announced the border trip on Twitter without providing details. The visit will likely highlight security concern pushed by the administration a justification for the wall. “The president’s position is: There is a crisis at the southern border, and Democrats are refusing to negotiate,” Pence said. The emphasis on a “crisis” could be the administration’s attempt to lay the groundwork for a potential emergency declaration. Such a decision would almost certainly face a legal challenge. Trump ha tried to link terrorism to illegal immigration, without providing evidence, a justification for the plan. Democrats say there ha been no evidence of suspected terrorist coming through the southern border and that Trump ha no ground to declare a national emergency over the issue. Large chunk of the federal government shut down on Dec. 22 over Trump’s demand that a bill to keep the federal government operational include more than $5 billion to pay for what he ha now said would be a steel structure to protect the border. About 800,000 government worker are furloughed or working without pay. Pence said Trump also invited Democrats back to the White House to respond to it latest proposal to resolve the standoff over legislation to fund the government. The vice president, who participated in weekend discussion on the shutdown, said Democratic staff said there would be no negotiation until the government is reopened. Trump said in December he would be “proud” to shut the government down over the wall and told lawmaker last week it could last months. The president skipped a planned trip to Florida to stay in Washington during the Christmas and New Year’s holiday after the partial shutdown began. He exhorted Democrats in Congress to “come back from vacation” and approve funding for his wall. Democrats returned to Washington in the new year, taking control of the House, and passed legislation to reopen all closed government agency but did not include wall funding. This week, they will pas a series of bill to reopen federal agencies. Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen told reporter in a briefing on Monday that terrorist had crossed the border into the United States but that information about the number of such incident wa sensitive or classified. Democrats say other border security measure are more efficient and cost-effective than a wall, which they say is contrary to American values.',\n",

The shooting shortly before midnight on Friday in the suburban community of Torrance triggered a manhunt for the suspect, who wa identified a Reginald Wallace. “At this time, we believe we have the sole shooter in this incident,” Torrance police chief Eve Irvine said at a news conference. Wallace, a resident of Los Angeles, ha not been formally charged in the shooting and it wa not immediately clear if he had obtained an attorney. SPONSORED He wa released from a California prison in 2017 after serving a 17-year sentence for assault with a firearm and wa on parole for that crime, Irvine said. The shooting followed an argument between two men at Gable House Bowl about 20 mile (30 km) south of downtown Los Angeles that grew into a melee with at least 10 people involved. Wallace pulled a handgun from his pocket and shot into the crowd, Irvine said. The bowling alley provided video which helped lead police to the suspect, who surrendered peacefully when he wa approached by heavily armed police in Los Angeles, Irvine said. He wa being held without bail in a county jail. The shooting wa a “senseless act of violence”, the police chief said.',\n",
       " 'Ousted Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn declared his innocence in his first public appearance since his November arrest, telling a Tokyo court on Tuesday that he had been wrongly accused of financial misconduct. Ghosn, credited with rescuing Nissan Motor Co (7201.T) from near-bankruptcy two decade ago, wa brought into the courtroom in handcuff and a rope around his waist. He wa wearing a navy suit and white shirt without a tie, and looked thinner than before his arrest, with his dark hair showing grey roots. “I have been wrongly accused and unfairly detained based on meritless and unsubstantiated accusations,” the 64-year-old executive told the Tokyo District Court in a clear voice, reading from a prepared statement. “I believe strongly that in all of my effort on behalf of the company, I have acted honourably, legally and with the knowledge and approval of the appropriate executive inside the company,” he said. From early morning, a crowd of journalist and television crew thronged outside the courthouse, and some 1,122 people lined up for 14 court seat assigned by lottery, highlighting strong interest in the case. News of the hearing wa given top billing on public broadcaster NHK throughout the day. The court hearing, requested by Ghosn’s lawyers, wa held to explain the reason for his prolonged detention since his Nov. 19 arrest rather than to argue merit of the case. Judge Yuichi Tada said the detention wa due to flight risk and possibility he could conceal evidence. But Ghosn used the opportunity to deny accusation against him, kicking off what is expected to be a lengthy counter-attack against the accusations. Former prosecutor Nobuo Gohara said the court appearance wa a public relation victory for Ghosn because it gave him an opportunity to counter the week of negative news about him. “In this high-profile case, news had been dominated by information from the prosecutor and Nissan, so the public tended to view him accordingly,” he said. “But today it wa all Ghosn. That’s very significant.” After week of silence, Ghosn’s lawyer insisted in an afternoon press conference that the court have no reason to keep him behind bar during the investigation. On Dec. 31, the Tokyo District Court granted prosecutors’ request to extend Ghosn’s detention by 10 day until Jan. 11. But former prosecutor Motonari Otsuru, who head Ghosn’s defence team, said it wa likely Ghosn would stay in custody until the trial starts, which could be in six months, given the practice in Japan of keeping defendant locked up until trial. The Tokyo District Court said later on Tuesday that Ghosn’s lawyer have asked for an end to his detention. One of Ghosn’s lawyers, Masato Oshikubo, told Reuters that a reply from the court to the request could come on Wednesday. Ghosn ha been formally charged with under-reporting his income. He ha also been arrested, but not yet indicted, on allegation of aggravated breach of trust in shifting personal investment loss to the carmaker. “I never received any compensation from Nissan that wa not disclosed, nor did I ever enter into any binding contract with Nissan to be paid a fixed amount that wa not disclosed,” Ghosn told the court. Regarding allegation that he transferred loss to Nissan, Ghosn said he had asked the company to temporarily take on his foreign exchange contract after the 2008-2009 financial crisis prompted his bank to call for more collateral. He said he did this to avoid having to resign and use his retirement allowance for collateral. “My moral commitment to Nissan would not allow me to step down during that crucial time,” said Ghosn. “A captain doesn’t jump ship in the middle of a storm.” Otsuru said that Nissan had agreed to the arrangement, on condition that any loss or gain would be Ghosn’s. Ghosn said the contract were transferred back to him and that Nissan did not incur a loss. Ghosn is also accused of paying $14.7 million (£11.5 million) to Saudi businessman Khaled Al-Juffali using Nissan fund in exchange for arranging a letter of credit to help with his investment losses. Ghosn said that Juffali’s company wa compensated for “critical service that substantially benefited Nissan”, including soliciting financing and resolving a business dispute. The Khaled Juffali Company ha issued a statement saying it had received the payment for legitimate business purposes. Nissan, which ha ousted Ghosn a chairman, reiterated that it internal investigation prompted by an informant had uncovered “substantial and convincing evidence of misconduct” and that it investigation wa ongoing and expanding in scope. The case ha rattled Nissan’s alliance with French automaker Renault SA (RENA.PA), where Ghosn remains chairman and chief executive. He had been pushing for a deeper tie-up, including potentially a full merger at the French government’s urging, despite strong reservation at Nissan. French Labour Minister Muriel Penicaud reiterated the government’s call for Nissan and Renault to preserve the alliance, seen a crucial for the two to compete long term amid trend such a autonomous driving. “The most important thing today is that the presumption of innocence is respected and that we look after the Renault-Nissan alliance. There are many job at stake,” she told a television news channel. Ghosn’s arrest ha also put Japan’s criminal justice system under international scrutiny and sparked criticism for some of it practices, including keeping suspect in detention for long period and prohibiting defence lawyer from being present during interrogation that can last eight hour a day. Ghosn ha been held at the Tokyo Detention Center, a spartan facility where small room have a toilet in the corner and no heater. His son, Anthony Ghosn, said his father had lost 10 kg (22 pounds) during his detention, according to France’s weekly Journal du Dimanche. Otsuru said Ghosn had been moved to a larger room with a western-style bed, but did not say when that had happened. Nissan’s Representative Director Greg Kelly, who wa also arrested on Nov. 19 and ha been charged with conspiring to under-report Ghosn’s income, wa released on Dec. 25 after posting bail of 70 million yen (£504,840), or about $640,000, in cash.',\n",
       " 'The following are prepared remark by Carlos Ghosn, ex-chairman of Nissan Motor Co (7201.T), for his court appearance in Tokyo on Tuesday regarding allegation against him of aggravated breach of trust. The statement wa released by Ghosn’s lawyer in the United States. Statement of Carlos Ghosn Your Honour, I am grateful to finally have the opportunity to speak publicly. I look forward to beginning the process of defending myself against the accusation that have been made against me. First, let me say that I have a genuine love and appreciation for Nissan. I believe strongly that in all of my effort on behalf of the company, I have acted honourably, legally, and with the knowledge and approval of the appropriate executive inside the company — with the sole purpose of supporting and strengthening Nissan, and helping to restore it place a one of Japan’s finest and most respected companies. Now I would like to address the allegations. 1. The FX Forward contract When I first joined Nissan and moved to Japan almost 20 year ago, I wanted to be paid in U.S. dollars, but wa told that wa not possible and wa given an employment contract that required me to be paid in Japanese yen. I have long been concerned about the volatility of the yen relative to the U.S. dollar. I am a U.S. dollar-based individual - my child live in the U.S. and I have strong tie to Lebanon, whose currency ha a fixed exchange rate against the U.S. dollar. I wanted predictability in my income in order to help me take care of my family. To deal with this issue, I entered into foreign exchange contract throughout my tenure at Nissan, beginning in 2002. Two such contract are at issue in this proceeding. One wa signed in 2006, when the Nissan stock price wa around 1,500 yen and the yen/dollar rate wa around 118. The other wa signed in 2007, when the Nissan stock price wa around 1,400 yen and the yen/dollar exchange rate wa around 114. The 2008–2009 financial crisis caused Nissan’s share to plummet to 400 yen in October 2008 and to 250 yen in February 2009 (down more than 80% from it peak) and the yen/dollar exchange rate dropped below 80. It wa a perfect storm that no one predicted. The entire banking system wa frozen, and the bank asked for an immediate increase in my collateral on the contracts, which I could not satisfy on my own. I wa faced with two stark choices: 1. Resign from Nissan, so that I could receive my retirement allowance, which I could then use to provide the necessary collateral. But my moral commitment to Nissan would not allow me to step down during that crucial time; a captain doesn’t jump ship in the middle of a storm. 2. Ask Nissan to temporarily take on the collateral, so long a it came to no cost to the company, while I gathered collateral from my other sources. I chose option 2. The FX contract were then transferred back to me without Nissan incurring any loss. 2. Khaled Juffali Khaled Juffali ha been a long-time supporter and partner of Nissan. During a very difficult period, Khaled Juffali Company helped Nissan solicit financing and helped Nissan solve a complicated problem involving a local distributor - indeed, Juffali helped Nissan restructure struggling distributor throughout the Gulf region, enabling Nissan to better compete with rival like Toyota, which wa outperforming Nissan. Juffali also assisted Nissan in negotiating the development of a manufacturing plant in Saudi Arabia, organising high-level meeting with Saudi officials. Khaled Juffali Company wa appropriately compensated - an amount disclosed to and approved by the appropriate officer at Nissan - in exchange for these critical service that substantially benefited Nissan. 3.The FIEL Allegations Four major company sought to recruit me while I wa CEO of Nissan, including Ford (by Bill Ford) and General Motors (by Steve Rattner, the then-Car Czar under President Barack Obama). Even though their proposal were very attractive, I could not in good conscience abandon Nissan while we were in the midst of our turnaround. Nissan is an iconic Japanese company that I care about deeply. Although I chose not to pursue the other opportunities, I did keep a record of the market compensation for my role, which those company offered me if I had taken these jobs. This wa an internal benchmark that I kept for my own future reference - it had no legal effect; it wa never shared with the directors; and it never represented any kind of binding commitment. In fact, the various proposal for non-compete and advisory service post-retirement made by some member of the board did not reflect or reference my internal calculations, underscoring their hypothetical, non-binding nature. Contrary to the accusation made by the prosecutors, I never received any compensation from Nissan that wa not disclosed, nor did I ever enter into any binding contract with Nissan to be paid a fixed amount that wa not disclosed. Moreover, I understood that any draft proposal for post-retirement compensation were reviewed by internal and external lawyers, showing I had no intent to violate the law. For me, the test is the “death test”: if I died today, could my heir require Nissan to pay anything other than my retirement allowance? The answer is an unequivocal “No.” 4. Contribution to Nissan I have dedicated two decade of my life to reviving Nissan and building the Alliance. I worked towards these goal day and night, on the earth and in the air, standing shoulder to shoulder with hardworking Nissan employee around the globe, to create value. The fruit of our labour have been extraordinary. We transformed Nissan, moving it from a position of a debt of 2 trillion yen in 1999 to cash of 1.8 trillion yen at the end of 2006, from 2.5 million car sold in 1999 at a significant loss to 5.8 million car sold profitably in 2016. Nissan’s asset base tripled during the period. We saw the revival of icon like the Fairlady Z and Nissan G-TR; Nissan’s industrial entry into Wuhon, China, St. Petersburg, Russia, Chennai, India, and Resende, Brazil; the pioneering of a mass market for electric car with the Leaf; the jumpstarting of autonomous cars; the introduction of Mitsubishi Motors to the Alliance; and the Alliance becoming the number one auto group in the world in 2017, producing more than 10 million car annually.

       " 'The White House sought to make the case on Monday that President Donald Trump had not changed his position on withdrawing U.S. troop from Syria, a day after his national security adviser outlined condition for a withdrawal that could take months. Trump’s abrupt announcement last month that he wa bringing home the roughly 2,000 troop in Syria, saying they had succeeded in their mission to defeat Islamic State there, sparked concern among official in Washington and ally abroad and prompted Defence Secretary Jim Mattis to resign. In recent days, Trump administration official have applied the brakes, making clear the withdrawal will not happen quickly. The president himself said last week that the United States would get out of Syria slowly “over a period of time.” “The president hasn’t changed his position, a he mentioned his primary goal is to ensure the safety of our troop and the safety of our ally a well,” White House spokeswoman Mercedes Schlapp told Fox News on Monday. “And so the Department of Defence will come up with it operational plan to safely withdraw our troops.” “It take time to take the troop out because we want to make sure that our troop are safe in this process,” she said. Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron discussed the two countries’ commitment to destroy Islamic State and “plans for a strong, deliberate, and coordinated withdrawal of U.S. troop from Syria” during a telephone call on Monday, the White House said. On Sunday, White House national security adviser John Bolton added a new condition to the U.S. withdrawal from Syria, saying Turkey must agree to protect the United States’ Kurdish allies. Trump reiterated on Sunday that the United States would pull it troop out of Syria but suggested the move might not happen soon. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told CNBC on Monday that the Syria drawdown is a “change of tactics” but reiterated that it doe not alter the U.S. commitment to defeat Islamic State and counter Iran’s influence in the region. Islamic State ha been beaten back from large area of territory it once controlled in Syria. But Trump’s announcement of a U.S. pullout left many question open, including whether Kurdish fighter who had been operating in northern Syria alongside U.S. force would be attacked by their long-time enemy, Turkey. Allies were also concerned that the withdrawal could leave the United States with few option to prevent a resurgence of Islamic State. As to whether Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan could be trusted not to turn on America’s Kurdish ally in Syria, Pompeo said “Erdogan made a commitment to President Trump” that those who fought with U.S. troop against Islamic State would be protected. He told CNBC that Bolton wa visiting Turkey this week “to have a conversation with the Turks about how they will effectuate that in light of the U.S. withdrawal.” Erdogan warned in an opinion piece in the New York Times on Monday that the U.S. withdrawal from Syria must be planned carefully and with the right partners, saying Turkey wa the only country “with the power and commitment to perform that task.” On Dec. 19, the day he first announced the pullout, Trump said in a video message, referring to the U.S. troops, “They’re all coming back and they’re coming back now. We won.” At the time, the White House declined to offer a timeline for withdrawal. However, one U.S. official said then that Washington aimed to withdraw troop within 60 to 100 day and a second official said they could leave even sooner.

The United States withdrawal, however, must be planned carefully and performed in cooperation with the right partner to protect the interest of the United States, the international community and the Syrian people,” Erdogan wrote. “Turkey, which ha NATO’s second largest standing army, is the only country with the power and commitment to perform that task.” On Sunday, Bolton added a new condition to the U.S. withdrawal from Syria, saying Turkey must agree to protect the United States’ Kurdish allies, who are seen a enemy by Ankara.

The United States ha slapped tariff on import of steel and aluminium from India, part of Trump’s drive to reduce the U.S. trade deficit and boost American manufacturing jobs. India ha threatened to retaliate but said it would not take action until the end of this month. In Afghanistan, Trump is planning to withdraw more than 5,000 of the 14,000 U.S. troop there, a U.S. official said last month. With a reduced military presence in Afghanistan, the United States would almost certainly have to curtail it missions, which include training and advising Afghan force and waging an air campaign against the Taliban and other militant groups.',\n",

Guanajuato’s state government said that le than one third of the state’s gas station were open on Monday. Lopez Obrador told a news conference the government had not established a date for when operation would return to normal, but stressed that supply wa not in danger. “We are changing the whole distribution system, that’s the reason for the shortage. We have enough gasoline,” he said. Mexican television showed long line of driver waiting to fill up in central state a well a Jalisco in the west and Tamaulipas in the north. Years of fuel theft by criminal group and others by tapping pipeline and stealing tanker truck ha led to loss totalling billion of dollar for public coffers. Lopez Obrador’s government ha ordered the armed force to intervene in Pemex’s facilities, including one refinery. “The supply will normalise, and at the same time we are going to guarantee that fuel is not stolen,” said Lopez Obrador, who took office in December. “We have seen a reduction in theft like never before ... but we still have work to do.” Guanajuato’s governor Diego Sinhue told local radio that of the state’s 415 gas stations, only 115 were open. In Leon, Guanajuato’s biggest city with a population of more than 1.5 million, only 7 of 196 station were open on Sunday, he said. “Fuel is becoming a serious problem,” said Sinhue, a member of the opposition centre-right National Action Party (PAN). “People are really angry about this shortage.” Sinhue said the army had informed him it had taken control of the state’s Salamanca refinery on Monday morning. There, member of the armed force were monitoring tanker going in and out of the facility, a well a the pressure of pipelines.

       " 'Tennessee’s governor on Monday commuted the life sentence of a woman convicted a a teenager of murdering a man who paid to have sex with her, after Kim Kardashian and other celebrity took up her cause. Cyntoia Brown, now 30, wa found guilty of first-degree murder in the killing of Johnny Allen, a 43-year-old Nashville real estate agent. She will walk out of prison on Aug. 7 after serving 15 years, Governor Bill Haslam’s office said. Brown wa 16 at the time of the murder. Brown received a life sentence with the possibility of parole after serving a minimum of 51 year in prison. Without the governor’s commutation, she would not have been eligible to be considered for parole until 2055 at the earliest. “Imposing a life sentence on a juvenile that would require her to serve at least 51 year before even being eligible for parole consideration is too harsh, especially in light of the extraordinary step Ms. Brown ha taken to rebuild her life,” Haslam, a Republican, said in a statement. Brown, who admitted to killing Allen, will be under parole supervision until Aug. 7, 2029, when her sentence will expire. In November 2017, the singer Rihanna referred to the case when wrote on her Instagram page: “Did we somehow change the definition of #JUSTICE along the way?? ... Something is horribly wrong when the system enables these rapist and the victim is thrown away for life!” Reality TV star Kardashian also drew attention to Brown’s case in November 2017 when she wrote in a Twitter message: “The system ha failed. It’s heart breaking to see a young girl sex trafficked then when she ha the courage to fight back is jailed for life!” While in prison, Brown earned her GED, or high school equivalency certificate, and an associate degree with a 4.0 grade point average. She is expected to complete a bachelor’s degree this year.

       " 'Criminal gang on a rampage in northeast Brazil are posing an early security test for new far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, highlighting the challenge he face in quelling drug-related violence and halting a record wave of murder in the country. The state of Ceará ha been rocked by five night of attack including a bomb that exploded under a highway, torched bus and assault against bank and police barracks. Security official believe the attack were triggered by the new state government’s plan to undercut the power of gang by sending prisoner to whatever jail have space to take them in, ending a longstanding practise of separating them according to gang affiliation. The attacks, which prompted Brazil’s new Justice Minister Sergio Moro to dispatch 406 federal security agent to Ceará, followed the Jan. 1 inauguration of Bolsonaro, who ha made no secret of his admiration for the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil from 1964-1985. The former army captain – who ran on a law-and-order platform - won support from Brazilians tired of the warring drug gang that have come to terrorise large swath of the country. His task now is to make good on promise to design a coherent federal security strategy and end the wave of violence that saddled Latin America’s largest nation with a record 63,880 murder in 2017. The murder tally last year is still unknown. In Ceará’s state capital Fortaleza, resident returned to the street on Monday, making their way to work warily. “The situation is tense,” said taxi driver Weverton Barbosa. “We’re scared, because we don’t know what’s coming, and it could get worse.” Ceará’s public security and defence ministry said on Monday 148 people had been arrested for their alleged role in the attacks. In a statement on Sunday, it said at least three suspected gang member had been killed in gun battle with police. Speaking last Friday, Bolsonaro, 63, praised Moro for quickly sending federal force into Ceará to try and ease the situation. But despite promising a tough stance on gangs, which profit from drug trafficking and often carry out mass attack to spread fear and in response to police crackdown in prison or on the streets, Bolsonaro ha provided few specific detail about how he will bring them to heel. At a press conference after his election, Bolsonaro urged prosecutor to follow the money to hobble prison gangs, such a Sao Paulo’s powerful First Capital Command and Rio de Janeiro’s Red Command. “Let’s fight organised crime and work to stop inmate from continuing to control their foot-soldiers from within prisons,” Bolsonaro tweeted on in October, shortly after his first-round election victory. On Friday, Bolsonaro asked lawmaker to quickly pas a bill to provide police and soldier freedom from prosecution when on active duty, warning that sky-high violence would only slow if law were passed to give security official a free hand a they combat gang violence. Last week, after being sworn in a justice minister, Moro said he would present an anti-crime bill within weeks, pledging to isolate the jailed leader of drug gangs, which he called a threat to democracy. Brazil’s constitution mandate that public security is managed by state governments, and Bolsonaro may be limited in what he can achieve to restore calm from the federal level. Ignacio Cano, a security expert at the Rio de Janeiro State University, said that given the high level of violence in the northeast of the country, and the inability of state government to cope with it, federal intervention such a the one in Ceará may become more prevalent under Bolsonaro. “I think this mechanism is something they will end up using a lot more than they expect,” he said. He added that gang crime posed a new challenge for Moro, who made his name a a crusading anti-graft judge, jailing score of Brazil’s corrupt political and business elite a part of the country’s notorious “Car Wash” probe. “Moro’s experience is in investigating white-collar crime, and now he will have to face a new, more violent type of criminal,” he said.

       " 'At the Siberia Tiger Park in the frigid Chinese city of Harbin, visitor can learn about the facility’s successful breeding programme and buy chicken carcass to toss to around 20 tiger pacing the snow flecked ground of their enclosure. At the park gates, a shop sell liquor soaked with tiger bone for up to $1,000 a bottle. China ha made significant stride in wildlife protection in recent years, including a total ban on ivory and plan to open one of the world’s largest reserve for wild tiger in northeast China in 2020. But it also ha formidable, profit-driven wildlife business interest that risk undermining progress on protecting the endangered big cats, conservationist say. “The industry occupies a strategic position which concentrate in the country’s le developed region where poverty reduction remains a top priority of the local authorities,” said Houston-based Peter Li, a China Policy Specialist at Humane Society International. Operators of tiger breeding farm have told state medium that without the ability to sell bones, skin and meat they are not be able to cover the high cost of running their park and carry out key conservation plan endorsed by the national government. After pressure from some breeders, China’s State Council said in October it would replace a 1993 ban on the trade of tiger bone and rhino horn, opening up exception under “special circumstances”, including medical research. But in November, Beijing postponed the move following widespread protest from conservation group who worry any resumption in the legal trade of tiger part will be a death knell for the specie by enabling the laundering of wild animal part into farmed supplies. Conservationists also argue that no captive Chinese bred tiger have been released into the wild and there is no scientific or medical need to use rhino horn and tiger bone in traditional Chinese medicine. Still, lifting the ban is backed by China’s powerful State Forestry and Grassland Administration. “If rhino horn and tiger bone can be used for medicinal purposes, and their use cause zero harm to the two endangered specie in the wild, why should we oppose it?” Tang Xiaoping, an executive at the administration wa quoted in the state-run China Daily newspaper. The Forestry and Grasslands administration did not respond to multiple request for comment. PROFIT-DRIVEN BUSINESS At the Siberia Tiger Park, tiger bone wine is sold openly and is recognized by the Forestry Bureau and Commerce Ministry, according to a sale representative in the store. However, the park is not allowed to publicly promote it due to the sensitivity of the situation, the sale rep said. Officials at the park declined to comment on the record. The wine, which range in price from 280 yuan-6,888 yuan, ($40-$1,003) is displayed in large glass cabinet and also sold on China’s Twitter-like WeChat. Park executives, official and conservation expert say tiger park have been accumulating stock of animal skin and bone in freezers, with the aim of selling it for medicinal use in the future. Conservation group estimate there are now over 6,500 farmed tiger at some 200 facility in China and around 40 farmed rhinos. Chinese medium say tiger bone can fetch 5,000-9,000 yuan ($727-$1,308) per kg - ten of thousand of dollar per animal. The World Wildlife Fund belief there are only around 40-50 wild tiger left in China out of around 3,900 globally. Debate over lifting the ban on tiger trade come a China seek to develop it traditional medicine industry, worth some $50 billion annually, and position it a a key pillar of it ‘One Belt One Road’ strategy. The World Health Organization is set to recognize traditional Chinese medicine for the first time next year in it global medical compendium according to Nature International Journal of Science, citing the governing body. The Siberian Tiger Park ha more than 1,300 tiger spread across three locations. Selling tiger bone wine is a way to subsidize the daily expense of the park, said one of the park’s tour guides. Currently, visitor fee are the parks’ main source of income, along with government subsidies. Ticket price are 100 yuan and visitor can pay extra to feed the tigers. A menu of meat display price for a live chicken at 120 yuan while a raw cutlet is 10 yuan. In a CCTV documentary shown in November, Liu Dan, the chief engineer of the Northeast Tiger Forest park, near China’s border with Russia, say his 1,000-plus tiger each eat around 3,000 yuan ($435) worth of chicken per month. Liu, who ha raised tiger for over 30 year and ha repeatedly called for the ban on trading tiger part to be lifted, told state medium that government tax break are not enough for the park to be financially viable. Currently, park make most of their money from visitors. Liu and the park declined to comment for this article. Chinese medicine expert say there is no need to use tiger bone and rhino horn in treatment a substitute are readily available. Tiger bone, for example, is often used to treat arthritis and joint pain, but there are dozen of other herb with similar properties, said Eric Karchmer, chief medicine officer at Dao Labs. Lixin Huang, the president of the American College of Traditional medicine, said a reversal of the ban would create a huge challenge for the Chinese medicine community. “We stopped using it 25 year ago. We don’t understand. I don’t think the Chinese medicine community and medical professional would understand.”',\n",

South Korea’s Hankyoreh newspaper, citing an unidentified source with close knowledge of North Korea-China affairs, reported that Kim wa travelling to Beijing late on Monday to meet with Xi. South Korea’s Yonhap news agency, citing an unspecified source familiar with North Korea issues, said a North Korean train possibly carrying a “high-level” official had crossed the border into China. The source told Yonhap it had not been confirmed whether a senior official wa on board, but that dozen of security vehicle and official had blocked the road around a station in the Chinese border city of Dandong a the train passed. Last year Kim travelled to China three time to meet with Xi, before and after Kim held other summit with U.S. President Donald Trump and South Korean President Moon Jae-in. Kim is expected to meet again with both the U.S. and South Korean president in the near future, and another visit to China ha been seen a a possible move before those summits. Earlier on Monday the South Korean newspaper Munhwa Ilbo reported that U.S. State Department official recently met multiple time with North Korean counterpart in Hanoi and discussed planning a second summit between Trump and Kim, fuelling speculation that Vietnam could host the event. The U.S. State Department and White House declined to comment on the Munhwa Ilbo report and the State Department referred query about Kim’s reported China visit to the Chinese government. In an interview with CNBC, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo praised China’s support for resolving the North Korean crisis and said he did not think the U.S. trade dispute with Beijing would affect this. “The Chinese have been very clear to u that these are separate issues,” Pompeo said. “Their behaviour ha demonstrated that a well and we appreciate that. China ha actually been a good partner in our effort to reduce the risk to the world from North Korea’s nuclear capability; I expect they will continue to do so.” At a landmark June summit in Singapore, Kim and Trump pledged to work towards denuclearisation, but the pact wa light on detail and talk since have made little headway. China is North Korea’s most important economic and diplomatic backer, despite anger over it neighbour’s nuclear and missile programmes. Ties have warmed in the last year a Pyongyang’s relation with both Seoul and Washington have also improved. China also played a role in Trump’s meeting with Kim, lending the North Korean leader an airliner for his trip to Singapore. Diplomatic source say Xi will probably go to North Korea at some point soon, which would make him the first Chinese leader to do so since 2005. In early December, Xi told North Korea’s foreign minister during a visit in Beijing that he “hoped North Korea and the United States meet each other halfway and address each other’s reasonable concerns, allowing positive progress on the peninsula’s nuclear talks.” Additional reporting by Josh Smith in Seoul and David Brunnstrom and Matt Spetalnick in Washington; Editing by Catherine Evans and James Dalgleish MORE FROM REUTERS SPONSORED All quote delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

Pence said Trump, in an address to the nation on Tuesday, would emphasise the White House’s position that a humanitarian and security crisis existed on the U.S. border with Mexico. Trump ha said he would consider declaring a national emergency to bypass Congress and proceed with construction of the wall without it approval. “He’s made no decision on that,” Pence said. Asked how thoroughly the White House counsel’s office had reviewed the possibility of a possible emergency declaration and the chance of accompanying legal challenges, Pence said: “They’re looking at it, and the president is considering it.” Asked why the administration did not put forward it current request for $5.7 billion (4.5 billion pounds) to fund the wall earlier in the budgeting process last year, Pence replied: “Things have gotten a lot worse.” Pence led talk between other senior administration official and congressional aide over the weekend, which he described a productive. A Democratic aide said they had not generated any progress. Pence noted that Democrats had said they would not negotiate until the government wa reopened. Democrats in the House of Representatives have passed measure to do just that, without funding for the wall. “The president’s position is: There is a crisis at the southern border, and Democrats are refusing to negotiate,” Pence said.

       " 'Former “House of Cards” star Kevin Spacey stood impassively in a Nantucket courtroom on Monday before pleading not guilty to sexually assaulting an 18-year-old man at an island bar over two year ago, a charge his lawyer dismissed a “patently false.” Spacey did not speak during a brief hearing in Nantucket District Court to face one count of felony indecent assault and battery, though a plea of not guilty wa entered on his behalf. Defense lawyer Alan Jackson persuaded Judge Thomas Barrett to order Spacey’s alleged victim to preserve all data from his cell phone for six month following the July 7, 2016, incident. He said in court paper the charge were based on “patently false allegations.” Jackson said police report showed the 18-year-old busboy exchanged numerous text message and Snapchat video with his then-girlfriend about his interaction with Spacey at the Club Car bar on the beach resort island off the coast of Massachusetts but never mentioned the alleged assault. Spacey could face up to five year in prison if convicted. The 59-year-old actor is one of dozen of men in entertainment, business and politics who have been accused of sexual misconduct since accusation against movie producer Harvey Weinstein in 2017 sparked the #MeToo movement. Monday’s hearing drew dozen of journalist from around the world at what is normally a quiet time of year on the island. Nantucket resident normally take pride in not making a fuss about rich and powerful vacationers, who have ranged from the NFL’s New England Patriots Head Coach Bill Belichick to former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, according to local media. Megan Keller, the manager of a coffee shop, called the prospect of a high-profile criminal trial “obnoxious.” “That’s not a reason I’d like people to come, because someone committed a crime,” she said. Spacey became embroiled in controversy in October 2017 when actor Anthony Rapp accused him of trying to seduce him in 1986 when Rapp wa 14. Spacey apologized for inappropriate conduct with Rapp. The controversy led to Spacey being dropped from the Netflix series “House of Cards” and erased from the film “All the Money in the World.” The Nantucket allegation were first raised in 2017 by former Boston television journalist Heather Unruh, who told reporter Spacey groped her teenage son. He told police Spacey had bought him several round of beer and whiskey and said, “Let’s get drunk,” according to charging documents. The busboy told investigator that Spacey groped him a they stood next to a piano. Reuters is not identifying Unruh’s son because he is an alleged victim of sex assault. “My client is a determined and encouraging voice for those victim not yet ready to report being sexually assaulted,” attorney Mitchell Garabedian said in an email. Other local said they hoped the case would not hurt the island’s reputation a a low-key getaway for the well-off. “If you’re famous and you don’t want to be seen, Nantucket is the place for you,” said Greg Margolis, the owner of the Corner Table Cafe.',\n",

Rebuilding and restoring Raqqa, which wa once home to more than 300,000 people, is proving a monumental task. Since losing almost all the large swathe of territory it took in lightning offensive in Syria and Iraq in 2014-15, IS ha returned to deadly hit-and-run attack and ambushes. Some people in Raqqa resent effective Kurdish control over the predominately Arab city, with many objecting to compulsory enlistment to it forces, heavy tax on civilian and a tight security grip where dissent is not tolerated.',\n",

       " 'North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is on his way to China for his fourth summit with China’s Xi Jinping, South Korean medium said on Monday. South Korea’s Hankyoreh newspaper, citing an unidentified source with close knowledge of North Korea-China affairs, reported that Kim wa travelling to Beijing late on Monday to meet with Xi. South Korea’s Yonhap news agency, citing an unspecified source familiar with North Korea issues, said a North Korean train possibly carrying a “high-level” official had crossed the border into China. The source told Yonhap it had not been confirmed whether a senior official wa on board, but that dozen of security vehicle and official had blocked the road around a station in the Chinese border city of Dandong a the train passed. Last year Kim travelled to China three time to meet with Xi, before and after Kim held other summit with U.S. President Donald Trump and South Korean President Moon Jae-in. Kim is expected to meet again with both the U.S. and South Korean president in the near future, and another visit to China ha been seen a a possible move before those summits. Earlier on Monday the South Korean newspaper Munhwa Ilbo reported that U.S. State Department official recently met multiple time with North Korean counterpart in Hanoi and discussed planning a second summit between Trump and Kim, fuelling speculation that Vietnam could host the event. The U.S. State Department and White House declined to comment on the Munhwa Ilbo report and the State Department referred query about Kim’s reported China visit to the Chinese government. In an interview with CNBC, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo praised China’s support for resolving the North Korean crisis and said he did not think the U.S. trade dispute with Beijing would affect this. “The Chinese have been very clear to u that these are separate issues,” Pompeo said. “Their behaviour ha demonstrated that a well and we appreciate that. China ha actually been a good partner in our effort to reduce the risk to the world from North Korea’s nuclear capability; I expect they will continue to do so.” At a landmark June summit in Singapore, Kim and Trump pledged to work towards denuclearisation, but the pact wa light on detail and talk since have made little headway. China is North Korea’s most important economic and diplomatic backer, despite anger over it neighbour’s nuclear and missile programmes. Ties have warmed in the last year a Pyongyang’s relation with both Seoul and Washington have also improved. China also played a role in Trump’s meeting with Kim, lending the North Korean leader an airliner for his trip to Singapore. Diplomatic source say Xi will probably go to North Korea at some point soon, which would make him the first Chinese leader to do so since 2005. In early December, Xi told North Korea’s foreign minister during a visit in Beijing that he “hoped North Korea and the United States meet each other halfway and address each other’s reasonable concerns, allowing positive progress on the peninsula’s nuclear talks.” Additional reporting by Josh Smith in Seoul and David Brunnstrom and Matt Spetalnick in Washington; Editing by Catherine Evans and James Dalgleish MORE FROM REUTERS SPONSORED All quote delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

       " 'U.S. President Donald Trump ha not made a decision on whether to declare a national emergency over his demand for border wall funding and the White House counsel’s office is studying the matter, Vice President Mike Pence said on Monday. “The Democrats need to start negotiating,” Pence told reporter in a briefing, adding that the Republican president had invited Democrats to return to the White House to respond to the administration’s proposal on how to end a partial government shutdown now in it third week. Pence said Trump, in an address to the nation on Tuesday, would emphasise the White House’s position that a humanitarian and security crisis existed on the U.S. border with Mexico. Trump ha said he would consider declaring a national emergency to bypass Congress and proceed with construction of the wall without it approval. “He’s made no decision on that,” Pence said. Asked how thoroughly the White House counsel’s office had reviewed the possibility of a possible emergency declaration and the chance of accompanying legal challenges, Pence said: “They’re looking at it, and the president is considering it.” Asked why the administration did not put forward it current request for $5.7 billion (4.5 billion pounds) to fund the wall earlier in the budgeting process last year, Pence replied: “Things have gotten a lot worse.” Pence led talk between other senior administration official and congressional aide over the weekend, which he described a productive. A Democratic aide said they had not generated any progress. Pence noted that Democrats had said they would not negotiate until the government wa reopened. Democrats in the House of Representatives have passed measure to do just that, without funding for the wall. “The president’s position is: There is a crisis at the southern border, and Democrats are refusing to negotiate,” Pence said. The acting director of the White House’s Office of Management and Budget, Russ Vought, said tax refund would be distributed despite the government shutdown.

       " 'Former “House of Cards” star Kevin Spacey stood impassively in a Nantucket courtroom on Monday before pleading not guilty to sexually assaulting an 18-year-old man at an island bar over two year ago, a charge his lawyer dismissed a “patently false.” Spacey did not speak during a brief hearing in Nantucket District Court to face one count of felony indecent assault and battery, though a plea of not guilty wa entered on his behalf. Defense lawyer Alan Jackson persuaded Judge Thomas Barrett to order Spacey’s alleged victim to preserve all data from his cell phone for six month following the July 7, 2016, incident. He said in court paper the charge were based on “patently false allegations.” Jackson said police report showed the 18-year-old busboy exchanged numerous text message and Snapchat video with his then-girlfriend about his interaction with Spacey at the Club Car bar on the beach resort island off the coast of Massachusetts but never mentioned the alleged assault. Spacey could face up to five year in prison if convicted. The 59-year-old actor is one of dozen of men in entertainment, business and politics who have been accused of sexual misconduct since accusation against movie producer Harvey Weinstein in 2017 sparked the #MeToo movement. Monday’s hearing drew dozen of journalist from around the world at what is normally a quiet time of year on the island. Nantucket resident normally take pride in not making a fuss about rich and powerful vacationers, who have ranged from the NFL’s New England Patriots Head Coach Bill Belichick to former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, according to local media. Megan Keller, the manager of a coffee shop, called the prospect of a high-profile criminal trial “obnoxious.” “That’s not a reason I’d like people to come, because someone committed a crime,” she said. Spacey became embroiled in controversy in October 2017 when actor Anthony Rapp accused him of trying to seduce him in 1986 when Rapp wa 14. Spacey apologized for inappropriate conduct with Rapp. The controversy led to Spacey being dropped from the Netflix series “House of Cards” and erased from the film “All the Money in the World.” The Nantucket allegation were first raised in 2017 by former Boston television journalist Heather Unruh, who told reporter Spacey groped her teenage son. He told police Spacey had bought him several round of beer and whiskey and said, “Let’s get drunk,” according to charging documents. The busboy told investigator that Spacey groped him a they stood next to a piano. Reuters is not identifying Unruh’s son because he is an alleged victim of sex assault. “My client is a determined and encouraging voice for those victim not yet ready to report being sexually assaulted,” attorney Mitchell Garabedian said in an email. Other local said they hoped the case would not hurt the island’s reputation a a low-key getaway for the well-off. “If you’re famous and you don’t want to be seen, Nantucket is the place for you,” said Greg Margolis, the owner of the Corner Table Cafe.',\n",
       " 'Yahya Jammeh wa going to be “trouble” for Gambia from the moment he seized power, the first witness to a commission convened to investigate right abuse under his presidency said on Monday. The Truth, Reconciliation and Reparations Commission (TRRC), which opened after repeated delay caused by a lack of funding, is part of a reckoning with a 22-year-long rule marked by extrajudicial killings, torture and forced disappearances. Testifying about the 1994 coup, police official Ebrima Ismaila Chongan recalled Jammeh, who later declared Gambia an Islamic republic, a a heavy drinker who wa often up to no good. “He used to come to me to beg for money and other things,” said Chongan, who trained Jammeh a a police cadet and later spent two year in the capital Banjul’s notorious Mile 2 Prison for opposing the coup. “When I knew that he wa the leader, I knew that Gambia wa going to be in trouble.” The TRRC, an initiative of current President Adama Barrow expected to sit for two years, plan to investigate the coup’s origin and abuse throughout Jammeh’s tenure, which ended in 2017 when he fled to Equatorial Guinea after losing an election. Atrocities uncovered in the past two year include the execution in 2005 of 52 migrant from neighbouring Senegal whose body were dumped down a well. At least 200 people crowded the exhibition hall of a Banjul hotel for the first day of hearings, with dozen more huddled outside within earshot while others tuned in across the country to live radio and television broadcasts. “Today is the day, and we want to hear from every single witness and victim,” said Baba Jallow, the commission’s executive secretary, who a a journalist in 2000 wa forced into exile by threat from Jammeh’s forces. “I am just grateful that the process ... is finally off the ground.” The 11-member commission can make criminal referrals, and many victim want to see Jammeh return to Gambia to face trial for the abuse it investigates. But that seems unlikely given the warm welcome he ha received from Equatorial Guinea’s President Teodoro Obiang. Previous truth and reconciliation commissions, a model popularised by hearing in South Africa in the 1990s that delved into it apartheid past, have received mixed review - seen a cathartic moment for victim but criticised for granting amnesty too liberally and only looking into politically significant cases.

More than 50,000 TSA officer are working without pay during the shutdown that began Dec. 22. They will be paid for back wage when the government reopens. “TSA officer are among the lowest paid federal employees, with many living paycheck-to-paycheck,” Thompson wrote in a letter Monday released by his office. “Officers may not be able to pay for rent, child care, and other necessity if their paycheck do not arrive on time... It is only reasonable to expect officer call out and resignation to increase the longer the shutdown lasts, since no employee can be expected to work indefinitely without pay.” TSA said it would respond to the letter but added that “publicly providing number of those who call out sick represents a security concern. That said, we’re not seeing significant number of people calling out and have not seen operational impacts.” On Monday, TSA said it had screened approximately 2.22 million passenger on Sunday and 99.8 percent of passenger waited le than 30 minutes.

       " 'Sudan said on Monday it had detained more than 800 people since protest began nearly three week ago in the most persistent challenge to President Omar al-Bashir’s three-decade rule. The figure, the first given by authority since the unrest erupted, wa far below the assessment of a leading human right activist who said about 2,000 people were detained. In a report to parliament, Interior Minister Ahmed Bilal Othman added that 381 demonstration had taken place and 127 police officer were injured during the demonstration triggered by price rise and shortage of cash. He said 14 police base and more than 100 police car had been burnt around Sudan. Authorities say 19 people, including two security officials, have died, while global right group Amnesty International said on Dec. 24 it had credible report 37 protester had been killed by bullet from security forces. Officers have been using live ammunition, tear gas and stun grenade to disperse protesters, witness say. Activist Barraq al-Nathir al-Warraq said on Friday that security force had detained around 2,000 people, including political activists, journalist and civil society members.

       " 'As the partial U.S. government shutdown entered it 17th day, no clear end wa in sight, with Republican President Donald Trump and congressional Democrats in a standoff over his demand for $5 billion (3.9 billion pounds) for a U.S.-Mexico border wall. It is hard to see how the impasse will be resolved but here are some possible scenario for how it might play out, a well a potential winner and losers, based on interview with lawmaker and aide in Congress and the Trump administration. As the closure of a quarter of the government begin to hurt the economy, both side could give ground and do a deal, possibly based on the following factors. * “Dreamers.” These mostly young Latin Americans are living in the United States after being brought into the country illegally a children. Trump could offer to protect them from deportation in return for wall money. A deal along these line wa nearly achieved previously but collapsed. * Barrier, not wall. Trump ha insisted on funding for a “wall” but he ha also talked about steel fencing. Tall, slatted fence already are in place in some spot on the border and more are being built. Funding for more slat could let Trump declare victory and let Democrats say they blocked a wall. The same could be said for steel mesh pedestrian barrier and other type of fencing. * Other steps. There are many additional way to fortify the U.S.-Mexico border, such a deploying more all-terrain vehicle and border guard on horses. Large metal detector also could be installed to scan truck and bus for illegal activities. * Follow the money. A dollar-figure bargain could be reached somewhere between Trump’s demand for $5 billion in wall funding and the Democrats’ offer of $1.6 billion for border security. Trump ha threatened to declare a national emergency, claiming that illegal immigration jeopardizes U.S. security and empowers him to redirect existing federal fund to build his wall, perhaps by tapping the Defence Department budget. Under the Constitution, Congress hold the power to make decision about spending U.S. taxpayers’ money. Such a step by Trump would escalate what is now a policy dispute into a fight over presidential powers. Democrats would almost certainly move to block Trump, likely kicking off a protracted court battle. Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer have vowed they will not give Trump any money to build a wall but a the shutdown grind on, they could have second thoughts, although this seems unlikely given the political climate. Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives by a landslide in November’s elections. Trump’s approval rating continues to hover at around 40 percent. There is plenty of skepticism among voter about the need for a wall, poll show. In addition, more voter blame Trump for the shutdown than congressional Democrats, a Reuters/Ipsos poll found in late December. Trump, whose main responsibility a president is to make sure that the federal government carry out it duties, could find the shutdown too politically hazardous a everyday problem increasingly confront average Americans. Closed national park and museum is one thing. But federal airport security screeners, now working without pay, have begun calling in sick, potentially causing delay for air travellers. Trump ha promised for year to build his wall - initially saying Mexico would pay for it - and ha repeatedly attacked Democrats for standing in his way. Now he may find the shutdown unsustainable, fold and endorse Democrats’ shutdown-ending bill while finding a way to claim victory. Bills passed by the House last week would fund the Department of Homeland Security through Feb. 8, giving the White House and Congress more time to negotiate on border security. Other agencies, such a Agriculture, Justice and Commerce, would have their funding restored under separate legislation. Democrats this week plan to start passing agency-by-agency funding bill in the House of Representatives that they would then send to the Senate. Republicans there would then have to decide whether to approve the bill or block them in the name of Trump’s wall project. Blocking a bill to fund the Treasury Department, for example, might delay Americans’ tax refunds.',\n",
       " 'President Donald Trump would almost certainly face a legal challenge if he carry out his threat to get funding for a U.S.-Mexico border wall by declaring a national emergency and circumventing Congress’s purse-strings power. Legal scholar said it wa unclear exactly how such a step would play out, but they agreed that a court test would likely focus on whether an emergency actually exists on the southern border and on the limit of presidential power over taxpayer funds. Declaring an emergency would likely end a 17-day-old partial government shutdown. But it could also result in a long court fight, possibly stretching into Trump’s 2020 reelection bid and emboldening critic who accuse him of authoritarian tendencies. Trump ha triggered a partial shutdown of the government by demanding the inclusion of $5 billion (3.9 billion pounds) for his proposed wall in any legislation to fully reopen agency whose funding expired on Dec. 22. When Trump first started vowing to build a wall, he pledged Mexico would pay for it. But Mexico refused and now Trump want U.S. taxpayer to pay for the roughly $23-billion project. The law Under the Constitution, decision about spending taxpayer fund and creating new policy are made by Congress. However, the president can make quick decision during emergency under a patchwork of law in specific situation such a war, natural disaster and epidemics. A 2007 report by the Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan research arm of the legislature, said: “Both the judiciary and Congress, a co-equal branches, can restrain the executive regarding emergency powers.” The National Emergencies Act of 1976 wa meant to create a congressional check on presidential emergencies. Under the law, the president must notify Congress and the public about an emergency declaration. Congress can override such a declaration, but it requires approval by both chambers. That could be hard to get with the House of Representatives under the control of Democrats, but the Senate in the hand of Trump’s fellow Republicans. The border Trump may argue illegal immigration constitutes a national emergency, entitling him to mobilise the military to the border and use Defence Department personnel to design and construct a wall. One way to challenge such an assertion would be to demand Trump show in court that an emergency actually exists. The money Even if Trump could convincingly declare an emergency, he would need to get his wall money out of fund already appropriated by Congress for other purposes. He could run into problem if he tried to shift fund dedicated to something else to his wall. Congress doe give federal agency some money without clear priorities. Trump would likely need to tap that kind of funding to avoid violating congressional authority. Trump hasn’t shied away in the past from unilateral action. But the liberal Centre for American Progress said a national emergency strategy would be “illegal, plain and simple.” House Democrats have already said they would be opposed. Mark Tushnet, a constitutional law professor at Harvard Law School, said, “It’s a very aggressive use of presidential authority. The fact that it’s aggressive doesn’t mean it’s unlawful. But it doe mean that it go beyond the boundary of what ha been done before.”',\n",

       " 'British new car sale in 2018 fell at their fastest rate since the global financial crisis a decade ago, hit by the collapse in demand for diesel, a the industry body warned of the existential threat to the sector posed by Brexit. Registrations dropped 6.8 percent last year to 2.37 million vehicles, the largest fall since sale nosedived 11.3 percent in 2008, according to data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) showed. A nearly 30 percent drop in demand for diesel wa the most significant factor in the decline. Diesel ha been pummelled since the Volkswagen emission cheating scandal of 2015, prompting a crackdown and higher levies. But the industry also warned that Britain’s departure from the European Union due at the end of March risk the future of a sector which employ over 850,000 people and ha been one of Britain’s few manufacturing success story since the 1980s. “It’s still hard to see any upside to Brexit,” said SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes. “Everyone recognises that Brexit is an existential threat to the UK automotive industry and we hope a practical solution will prevail,” he said, calling for lawmaker to back Prime Minister Theresa May’s deal to guarantee a transition period. Britain, the world’s fifth largest economy, is due to leave the globe’s biggest trading bloc in just over 80 day with May’s agreement looking set to be voted down, leading to a possible no deal Brexit and the imposition of tariff and custom checks. Investment look very likely to have fallen in 2018, the SMMT said, and sale this year are forecast to drop again a the industry body warned a no-deal Brexit would hit jobs. “You’re not going to see immediate closure of plant but what you could see is a reduction in production volume and certainly, these are often international company who have alternatives,” said Hawes. After record high in 2015 and 2016, sale fell in 2017 and some analyst see car demand a a leading indicator which could be a harbinger for future economic performance. Britain’s economy slowed to a crawl at the end of 2018, the housing market is stalling and lending to consumer growing at it slowest pace in nearly four years, according to data released on Friday. Diesel, which accounted for 48 percent of sale in 2016, fell to 42 percent in 2017 and just 32 percent in 2018, mirroring a trend seen in many European markets. The rise in petrol sale and drop in diesel mean the average CO2 emission of new car sold in Britain in 2018 rose just under 3 percent, posing a headache for automaker who need to reduce level to meet stricter regulations. New rule which came into force in September also impacted sale by disrupting the supply of some models, the SMMT said. Demand this year could also be distorted if Britons expect tariff to be introduced after Brexit, perhaps pushing up registration in the first three month of 2019. “The fear of them might encourage some people to purchase in the first quarter,” said Hawes. “The flip side of that is: ‘Well I don’t know what’s going to happen to the economy if you have a no deal so I’ll wait and see’.” Editing by Stephen Addison/Guy Faulconbridge MORE FROM REUTERS SPONSORED All quote delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

Tensions between Iran and the United States have increased since May, when President Donald Trump abandoned a 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and major power and later reimposed sanction on Iran that had been lifted under the pact. “During my visit to Kabul last month, the Americans ... asked to hold talks,” Ali Shamkhani, the secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council and a close aide to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, wa quoted a saying, without specifying what the U.S. side wanted to discuss. “This report is not accurate,” said a State Department spokeswoman on condition of anonymity. While denying it made a specific overture to Shamkani, the spokeswoman repeated that Trump is open to a dialogue with Iran on “urgent national security issues” and want Tehran to “make fundamental change in their destructive behaviour.” Washington accuses Tehran of destabilising the region by projecting it power via proxy in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen. In 2001, Iran worked with the United States to help set up a new Afghan government to replace the Taliban, which had been toppled by a U.S.-led military campaign following al Qaeda’s September 11 attack on U.S. cities. Shamkhani wa in Kabul last month for talk with the Taliban “to help curb the security problem in Afghanistan.” He said the Kabul government had known of his talk with the Taliban. Majority-Shi’ite Iran ha long had close tie to Shi’ites in neighbouring Afghanistan whose militia have fought the Taliban’s Sunni militants. Washington accuses Iran of trying to extend it influence in western Afghanistan by providing military training, financing and weapon to the Taliban, a charge Tehran denies. Shamkhani’s comment came day after report of talk between U.S. and Taliban official over proposal for a ceasefire in Afghanistan and a future withdrawal of foreign troop ahead of possible peace negotiations. Khamenei slapped down an offer of direct talk made by Trump last year and Iranian official have said Washington’s crippling sanction would fail to wreck the economy. In July, Iranian authority said Tehran had rejected eight U.S. request for a meeting between Trump and President Hassan Rouhani on the sideline of the U.N. General Assembly in Sept 2017.

He denies charge of assisting follower of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, who is accused of orchestrating a failed 2016 putsch. Prosecutors sought a sentence of up to 19 year for Erdem over “membership of an armed organisation” and aiding terrorists, Anadolu said. However, the court ruled on Monday that he should be released on bail. Hours later, a higher court overturned the release ruling, following an appeal by the Istanbul prosecutor’s office on ground that Erdem may flee. He is the second politician from the secularist Republican People’s Party (CHP) to be detained in a sweeping security crackdown since the attempted military coup that ha sparked outrage from right group and some of Turkey’s Western allies. The other CHP politician, Enis Berberoglu, wa initially sentenced to 25 year in jail on espionage charge in June 2017, but wa later released in September. He also denies the charge against him. The cleric Gulen, a former ally of President Tayyip Erdogan who now life in the United States, denies any connection with the 2016 attempt to overthrow the government. Since then, 77,000 people have been formally arrested, while more than 150,000 civil servants, military personnel and others have been sacked or suspended from job over alleged link to Gulen’s network. Foes have criticised the scale of the crackdown, saying Erdogan wa using the putsch a an excuse to quash dissent. The government ha said the measure are justified by the gravity of the threat. There wa no immediate reaction from Erdem’s family or supporters.',\n",
       " 'Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, contesting an April election under the shadow of possible corruption charges, demanded on Monday to confront the state’s witness against him. Announcing on Twitter, three hour beforehand, that he would make a “special announcement” on Israeli TV, Netanyahu - now in his fourth term - touched off a wave of social medium speculation that he might resign or even launch legal action of his own to try to stay any indictment. Instead, he kicked off Israel’s main TV evening news programme with an anticlimactic speech in which he again professed his innocence in a series of corruption cases. He contended he wa a victim of a political witchhunt and said he wa being denied the chance to challenge his accuser face-to-face. “I demand a confrontation with the state’s witness now. What are they afraid of? What do they have to hide? I am not afraid and I have nothing to hide...As far a I am concerned it can be broadcast live, so the public can see and hear it.” In response, Israel’s Justice Ministry said the investigation against Netanyahu - who is now in his fourth term - have been carried out professionally and thoroughly. Netanyahu’s calling of the snap election, ahead of a national ballot due by November, wa widely seen a a direct appeal to voter for a fresh political mandate that could help him weather a potential indictment. Netanyahu, who head the right-wing Likud party, said investigator had twice turned down his request to confront the witnesses. At least three ex-Netanyahu confidant have agreed to provide evidence against him, Israeli medium report said. Netanyahu is enmeshed in three graft cases. He ha said he would not bow out of the election race if Israel’s attorney-general announces his intention to accept police recommendation to indict him. Should he decide on an indictment, the attorney-general would, under Israeli law, then hold a hearing with Netanyahu in which the prime minister and his lawyer could make their case against filing charge in court. There ha been mounting speculation in Israel that an indictment decision will be announced in the next few weeks, before election day. Police have alleged that Netanyahu granted regulatory favour to Israel’s leading telecommunication company, Bezeq Telecom Israel, in return for more positive coverage on a news website belonging to the firm’s owner. In a second case, police contend that Netanyahu received expensive gift from wealthy friends. A third investigation focus on suspicion that Netanyahu negotiated a deal with one newspaper for better coverage in return for promise to back legislation that would have limited the circulation of a rival.

Cardinal Philippe Barbarin, who stand trial alongside five others from his diocese, is accused of failing to report allegation of sexual abuse on Boy Scouts in the 1980s and early 1990s by Father Bernard Preynat. Preynat ha admitted sexual abuse, according to his lawyer, and is due to go on trial later this year. “I never sought to conceal or cover up the facts,” Barbarin said on the first day of trial in Lyon. “I am grateful justice intervened in this affair, but I didn’t think it wa up to me to file a complaint, especially since the victim wa told it wa too late to act,” he said. “I can’t see what I am guilty of.” While most of the recent focus in the Church’s global abuse crisis ha been on Australia and Chile, Barbarin’s trial put the spotlight on Europe’s senior clergy again, just a Pope Francis prepares to host a meeting of senior bishop from around the world in Rome next month to discus the protection of minors. Barbarin, who moved to the Lyon diocese in 2002, visited the priest in his parish the same year but said he had not checked Preynat’s file, where mail from parent denouncing the abuse wa recorded, before doing so. After being officially informed of Preynat’s action in 2014, Barbarin said he convinced one of the alleged victims, Alexandre Hezez, to write a letter describing the facts, which he passed on to Church hierarchy in Rome. He removed the priest from his post in 2015, six month after being told to do so by the Vatican. “It wa to avoid public scandal, just a Rome had suggested,” he told the court. Lyon prosecutor had previously investigated Barbarin but dropped the probe in the summer of 2016 without a detailed explanation. However, an association of alleged victim called Parole Liberee (“Freed Word”) used a provision of French law to compel the cardinal to stand trial. Pope Francis ha come under fire over the Church’s handling of the spreading sexual abuse crisis. He met Barbarin in early 2016, and later told the Catholic newspaper La Croix that it would make no sense for the cardinal to resign before any eventual trial.',\n",

The plan have raised concern that NGO activity might be restricted by a nationalist government that ha criticized foreign interference in the Amazon region. The responsibility for monitoring NGOs ha been put in the hand of Government Secretary Carlos do Santos Cruz, a retired Army general who ha said the initiative will help determine whether the organization are fulfilling their role of carrying out work that complement government actions. An executive order issued last week gave the new administration potentially far-reaching and restrictive power over NGOs. “The government’s intention is to optimise the use of public fund and bring more benefits” to people assisted by the NGOs, Cruz said in an interview published on Monday on the G1 news portal. He denied the intention wa to restrict their activity. “The plan is not to interfere in the life of the organization or restrict anything. But it’s public money. There need to be transparency and there need to be results,” Cruz said. Jurema Werneck, the executive director of Amnesty International Brazil, expressed concern about the new measures, saying NGOs were crucial in maintaining check and balance on democratic institutions. Eroding their influence could lead to a rise in right violations, she said. The “unprecedented” move on NGOs showed that Bolsonaro’s government “intends to intervene in their activities, favouring a process of criminalisation and restriction of freedom of expression,” said Werneck. Increasing oversight over NGOs wa one of Bolsonaro’s very first act after he wa sworn in on Jan. 1.

       " 'British carmaker Aston Martin (AML.L) ha triggered contingency plan to cope with a potentially disorderly Brexit, including hiring a new supply chain chief and preparing to fly in component a well a use port other than Dover. Britain, the world’s fifth largest economy, is due to leave the European Union in just over 80 day but a negotiated withdrawal agreement look set to be voted down by MPs next week, making a “no deal” exit - and disruption to trade - more likely. Britain’s car industry, which employ over 850,000 people and is one of the country’s rare manufacturing success stories, ha warned that leaving the world’s biggest trading bloc without a deal would add cost and could halt output due to snarl-ups. Aston Martin Chief Executive Andy Palmer said the luxury automaker, which outlined it contingency plan in October, had no choice but to authorise them at a board meeting in December. “I don’t think we’ve been in a position in the last two year where we’ve been further apart from understanding where we’re going to end up,” Palmer told Reuters, declining to put a figure on the “accumulating” cost of the plans. “We programme a car to align and order all the part for those car twelve week in advance. You don’t need to do the math to know that therefore take u across the Brexit period.” “We have to prepare for the worst case scenario.” Aston Martin, the preferred drive of fictional secret agent James Bond, join a growing list of company readying for a no deal Brexit. Data last week showed manufacturer ramping up stock in preparation for potential border delays. Aston is signing deal with supplier DHL to allow for the use of port other than Dover - Britain’s busiest and so most likely to be disrupted by any custom delay - and ha authorised it supply chain team to make air freight bookings. The government ha said it will prioritise the movement of key supply such a medicine if the flow of good is hit after Brexit, so it is unclear what would happen to other items. “We don’t have any assurances,” said Palmer. “One assumes if you’re putting part onto a standard chartered plane, no one’s going to kick you off.” Aston Martin, which built more than 6,000 top-end model last year at it central English plant in Gaydon, it only factory, is also holding a stock of car in Germany. “It’s an inventory to some extent that we put in place during the course of 2018 ... and depending on what happens in the next few weeks, may or may not increase,” Palmer said. Carmakers fear their just-in-time production will grind to a halt if there are delay imposed after Brexit, but different manufacturer face different challenges. Volkswagen Group (VOWG_p.DE), Britain’s favourite carmaker accounting for over 20 percent of sales, build only 11,000 Bentleys in the country, while Ford (F.N) count Britain a it third-largest market but make no car there. Meantime Nissan (7201.T), which build around half a million car at it northern English Sunderland plant, and Toyota (7203.T) export the overwhelming majority of their British-built vehicle to the rest of the EU. While mass-market brand are most worried about potential trade tariffs, smaller, high-end player such a Aston and McLaren believe their affluent customer could absorb extra cost and are more concerned about custom check and delays. Aston ha hired John Griffiths, who ha worked for Nissan and aerospace firm Rolls-Royce, a interim vice president for supply chain, in a role Palmer said “there wa a nagging need (for) which ha been confirmed with Brexit.” Palmer criticised politician on both side of the Channel. “Both the European and the UK politician are not discharging the duty for which they are put in place which is basically to plan and bring certainty to allow the country to thrive,” he said. As carmaker prepare for multiple Brexit eventualities, they are also dealing with stricter emission rule and a slowdown in the world’s second-biggest economy, China, which ha hit a variety of firm including Apple (AAPL.O). While some automaker have reported falling demand, Aston, which ha seen it share price fall by more than a third since it listed in October, said it had a record 2018. “There ha not been any downflow since those (Q3) number so in fact, broadly speaking, the opposite a we launched (sports cars) DBS and Vantage into China,” said Palmer.

Her relative have not commented on her accusation of abuse and Reuters wa not able to reach them. The case ha drawn new global attention to Saudi Arabia’s strict social rules, including a requirement that woman have the permission of a male “guardian” to travel, which right group say can trap woman and girl a prisoner of abusive families. It come at a time when Riyadh is facing unusually intense scrutiny from it Western ally over the killing of a journalist at it consulate in Istanbul in October and over the humanitarian consequence of it war in Yemen. Thai immigration official had planned to put Qunun on a flight back to Kuwait on Monday, but relented after her online plea drew international attention. She told Reuters via text and audio message she had fled Kuwait during a family visit there, and had planned to travel to Australia to seek asylum. She said she wa held after leaving her plane in Bangkok and told she would be sent back to Kuwait. “They will kill me,” Qunun told Reuters. “My life is in danger. My family threatens to kill me for the most trivial things.” A representative of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) met Qunun at the airport and also discussed the case with Thai immigration officials.

They threaten to kill me and prevent me from continuing my education. “They won’t let me drive or travel. I am oppressed. I love life and work and I am very ambitious but my family is preventing me from living.” The Saudi foreign ministry said in a tweet that it embassy wa in touch with the woman’s father and the Thai government, but it diplomat had not met or communicated with her. New York-based Human Rights Watch said Thailand should not send Qunun back to her family because she say she face danger. Qunun said she had obtained an Australian visa and booked a flight. She said she had planned to spend a few day in Thailand so she would not spark suspicion when she left Kuwait. Thai immigration chief Surachate, however, said that Qunun did not have a visa for Australia. The Australian Embassy said it had no immediate comment. Contradicting earlier account from Thai officials, Surachate said Thai authority had been contacted by the Saudis before deciding to deny Qunun entry to the country. “The Saudi Arabia embassy contacted the immigration police ... and said that the girl had run away from her parent and they fear for her safety,” he said. “We acknowledged this and checked her paperwork. She had a passport but no return ticket, no travel plan, and no destination or hotel reservation in Thailand ... so per airport security procedures, immigration denied her entry.” Additional reporting by Panarat Thepgumpanat and Panu Wongcha-um in BANGKOK and Ghaida Ghantous in DUBAI; Editing by Nick Macfie and Peter Graff MORE FROM REUTERS SPONSORED SPONSORED All quote delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

Robin Lovell-Badge, organiser of the November 2018 event where China’s He Jiankui made his controversial presentation, described him a a rich man with a “huge ego” who “wanted to do something he think will change the world”. He Jiankui, associate professor at Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, China, sparked an international scientific and ethical row when he said he had used a technology known a CRISPR-Cas9 to alter the embryonic gene of twin girl born in November. He did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. Chinese authority are investigating him and have meanwhile halted this kind of research. In video posted online and at the conference, He said he believed his gene editing would help protect the girl from infection with HIV, the virus that cause AIDS. Lovell-Badge, a professor and gene expert at Britain’s Francis Crick Institute who led the organising committee for the November Human Genome Editing Summit at Hong Kong University, said it wa impossible to know what He had actually done. “If it’s true (that he edited the genome in the way he says) then it is certainly possible that he ha put the children’s life at risk,” he told journalist in London. “No-one know what these mutation will do.” Lovell-Badge said he originally invited He to the conference after hearing in scientific circle that he wa “up to something”. Lovell-Badge hoped that asking He to interact with specialist would encourage him to “control his urges”. “Pretty much everyone he talked to had said to him: ‘Don’t do it’,” he said. “But clearly it wa all too late.” Lovell-Badge said he learned of He’s claim on the eve of the conference, and had an emergency meeting with him. “He thought that he wa doing good, and that what he wa doing wa the next big thing,” Lovell-Badge said.

The Roman Catholic Church worldwide is reeling from crisis involving sexual abuse of minor in a number of country including Chile, the United States, Australia and Ireland. In devoutly Catholic Poland, debate on the issue ha barely begun, but the anti-paedophilia foundation “Have no fear” is compiling a report on abuse and said it would soon inform Polish prosecutor of 20 previously unreported sexual crimes. “By the end of January we will have a report documenting Polish bishops’ negligence which will be presented in February at the Vatican,” Joanna Scheuring-Wielgus, an activist and lawmaker from the small opposition party “Now”, told a news conference. “When it turned out that bishop in Chile had concealed paedophile crimes, they lost their jobs. Plenty of bishop in Poland should bear the same consequences,” she said. Senior bishop from around the world are due to meet Pope Francis at a conference in the Vatican in February to discus protection of minors. Organisers say the Church must show full accountability or risk losing further credibility worldwide.

The economy wa long buoyed by oil revenues, much of which went to a moneyed elite while most of the two-million population live in deep poverty. In Libreville, expensive western hotel overlook the Atlantic Ocean to the west and the capital’s hillside shanty to the east. A sharp drop in oil output and price in recent year ha squeezed revenues, raised debt and stoked discontent. Oil workers’ strike have become more common. Economic growth wa 2 percent last year, down from over 7 percent in 2011. The coup indicates “broad socio-economic and political frustration with Gabon’s leadership, which ha been weakened by the suspected incapacitation of it strongman president,” Exx Africa Business Risk Intelligence said in a report. The international community condemned the coup attempt, including former colonial ruler France which urged it 8,900 citizen registered in Gabon to avoid moving around Libreville. “Gabon’s stability can only be ensured in strict compliance with the provision of it constitution,” French foreign ministry spokeswoman Agnes von der Muhll said. African Union Commission Chairman Moussa Faki Mahamat reaffirmed “the AU’s total rejection of all unconstitutional change of power.” In a video on social media, Ondo is seen in a radio studio wearing military fatigue and a green beret a he read the statement. Two other soldier with rifle stand behind him. Ondo said the coup attempt wa by a group called the Patriotic Movement of the Defence and Security Forces of Gabon against “those who, in a cowardly way, assassinated our young compatriot on the night of August 31, 2016,” a reference to violence after Bongo wa declared winner of a disputed election. Bongo won the poll by fewer than 6,000 votes, sparking deadly clash between protester and police during which the parliament wa torched. “President Bongo’s record a defence minister under his father lower the possibility that current military leadership is supportive of his ouster,” said Judd Devermont of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. France ha a permanent force of 300 soldier in Gabon. The United States also sent about 80 soldier to Gabon last week in response to possible violence in Democratic Republic of Congo after a presidential election there. Foreign government have often suspected Bongo and member of his government of corruption, accusation they have denied. During his father’s rule, Gabon wa a pillar of “La Francafrique”, a web of influence that gave French company favoured access to African autocrats. Gabon’s dollar-denominated sovereign debt <XS1003557870=TE > <US362420AC51=TE > tumbled in early trading, with both outstanding bond losing around 3 cent in the dollar.

       " 'A U.S. guided-missile destroyer sailed near disputed island in the South China Sea in what China called a “provocation” a U.S. official joined talk in Beijing during a truce in a bitter trade war. The USS McCampbell carried out a “freedom of navigation” operation, sailing within 12 nautical mile of the Paracel Island chain, “to challenge excessive maritime claims”, Pacific Fleet spokeswoman Rachel McMarr said in an emailed statement. The operation wa not about any one country or to make a political statement, McMarr said. The statement came a trade talk between China and the United States were under way in Beijing, the first round of face-to-face discussion since both side agreed to a 90-day truce in a trade war that ha roiled international markets. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said the conduct of the U.S. ship had violated China’s and international law, and China had lodged “stern representations”. “We urge the United States to immediately cease this kind of provocation,” he said, adding that China had sent military ship and aircraft to identify and warn off the ship. China’s defence ministry added that the ship had “gravely infringed upon China’s sovereignty”. “We will be on high alert and will closely monitor the air and sea situation to strongly defend our sovereignty and security,” it said in comment carried by state media. Asked about the timing of the operation during trade talks, Lu said resolving issue would help both country and the world. “Both side have the responsibility to create the necessary positive atmosphere for this,” he said. China claim almost all of the strategic South China Sea and frequently lambastes the United States and it ally over naval operation near Chinese-occupied islands. Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Indonesia and Taiwan have competing claim in the region. U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in December agreed to put on hold a spiralling trade dispute of tit-for-tat import tariff on hundred of billion worth of goods. Trump ha imposed tariff to pressure Beijing to change it practice on issue ranging from corporate espionage to market access and industrial subsidies. China ha retaliated with tariff of it own. Fears have grown in recent month that the dispute is just one vector in a bilateral relationship that is fast cooling across the board, with top administration official sharply criticizing Beijing for everything from human right abuse and it influence operation in the United States. The two country are also at odds over regional security, including Washington’s overture to the self-ruled island of Taiwan, which Beijing claim a it own. China and the United States have in the past repeatedly traded barb over what Washington say is Beijing’s militarization of the South China Sea by building military installation on artificial island and reefs. China defends it construction a necessary for self-defence and say that it is rather Washington that is responsible for ratcheting up tension in the region by sending warship and military plan close to island Beijing claims.',\n",

Thousands of Cambodian survivor of the Khmer Rouge marked the 40th anniversary of their demise in a commemoration in Phnom Penh on Monday. About 60,000 people gathered at a stadium in the capital, where dancer and performer held banner and waved flag in scene reminiscent of an Olympic opening ceremony. The event wa organised by the ruling Cambodian People’s party (CPP), whose Prime Minister Hun Sen ha led the Southeast Asian country for more than 33 years. The 66-year-old, a former member of the Khmer Rouge, came to power under a government installed by Vietnam, which invaded Cambodia at the end of 1978 and captured Phom Penh on Jan. 7, 1979, ending Khmer Rouge rule and forcing it leader, Pol Pot, into hiding. Much of the event wa dedicated to the achievement of Hun Sen, who ha come under fire from right group for his intimidation of political opponent and for winning a widely criticised general election last July. Songs praising the prime minister a a “peaceful and loyal statesman” echoed through the stadium. Traditional dancer performed in honour of his policies. Outside, survivor like Srey Heng, now a street vendor selling water and soft drinks, cast a more sombre figure compared with the scene inside. “Many of my relative died under Pol Pot because they were hungry, Srey Heng said. “I don’t even know what happened to the others”. An estimated 1.7 million people died at the hand of the extremist, communist regime. Most victim died of torture, starvation, disease, or exhaustion in labour camps. Others were beaten to death during mass executions. Seang Tharuon, 69, lost 11 sibling and both her parent during the killings. She wa forced by the Khmer Rouge to marry her husband. Like many others, Seang Tharuon wa evacuated from Phom Penh by the Khmer Rouge at the start of it nightmarish rule. She walked for more than 100 km (62 miles) from the countryside back to the capital when the regime fell in 1979. “We mainly had gruel to eat, and they would let u eat rice once a month,” Seang Tharuon told Reuters a she bought drink from Srey Heng’s stall outside the stadium. In downtown Phnom Penh, former Khmer Rouge soldier Prum Punly balanced on one leg a he fed bird by the river. He lost his other leg to a landmine while fighting against U.S.-backed Cambodian government force in 1975, a the Khmer Rouge came to power: “I wa too young to understand politics,” the 67-year-old said. “It wa chaos”.',\n",

They got it in 1962, making the Southwestern state the last in the nation to extend it. On Thursday, Haaland welcomed her new constituent to an open house at her congressional office before being sworn in on the House floor. She wore traditional tribal garment to the ceremony, including a pomegranate blossom necklace of silver and turquoise, signifying protection and strength, made by a Laguna artist. After raising her hand to take the oath of office with her peers, the consequence of the milestone sunk in.

       " 'Pope Francis warned on Monday against a resurgence of nationalist and populist movement and criticised country that try to solve the migration crisis with unilateral or isolationist actions. The pope, speaking to diplomat in an annual speech known informally a his “state of the world” address, suggested such movement and closed-door policy were turning the clock back 100 year to the dangerous period between the world wars. Relationships within the international community “are experiencing a period of difficulty, with the resurgence of nationalistic tendencies,” he said, making dialogue between country and hurting the most vulnerable member of society, including migrants. Populist anti-immigrant party made gain in a number of country last year, including Italy, France, the Netherlands, Hungary, Brazil and Poland. In the United States, a partial government shutdown entered it third week a President Donald Trump ha pledged not to bend in his demand for a wall along the southern border with Mexico.. In his hour-long speech, Francis several time mentioned the League of Nations, which wa set up after World War One to promote peace but failed to stop the nationalist and populist movement that helped lead to World War Two. “The reappearance of these impulse today is progressively weakening the multilateral system,” he told envoy from 183 country in the speech, which touched on the situation in many countries. While migration ha led to diffidence and unilateral action by governments, particularly in Europe and North America, the international community ha a duty to defend refugee and migrants, he said. “I do not believe that partial solution can exist for so universal an issue,” he said. Francis praised the United Nations’ Global Compact on Migration, which set objective for how the movement of people can be managed. The United States, Italy, Hungary and Poland are among nation that boycotted the meeting in Morocco last year. The pope again condemned the arm trade and possession of nuclear weapons, lamenting that past effort at nuclear disarmament had given way to “the search for new and increasingly sophisticated and destructive weapons”.

       " 'Ukraine’s Orthodox Christian Church celebrated it first Christmas on Monday outside Russian control and President Petro Poroshenko said the document enshrining it newly gained independence had broken “the last fetter tying u to Moscow”. Hundreds of Ukrainians queued in the snow after the lavish two-hour liturgy at Kiev’s St Sophia Cathedral to view the document, known a a “Tomos”, which wa only handed to the head of the new Church Metropolitan Epifaniy on Sunday. Many Orthodox Christians celebrate Christmas on Jan. 7, not Dec. 25, a they follow a different calendar. Accompanied by Poroshenko, Epifaniy processed into the cathedral on Monday carrying the decree, a scrolled white parchment. White-robed clergy then unfurled it and placed it in front of the iconostasis, a richly decorated screen that separate the sanctuary from the nave in Orthodox churches. “For the first time, we celebrate Christmas with an independent autocephalous church,” said Poroshenko after the service. “It is the basis of our spiritual freedom, we broke the last fetter tying u to Moscow,” said the president, who face a tough re-election battle this year. Russia bitterly opposes the move to grant the Ukrainian Church autocephalous, or self-governing, status, comparing it to the Great Schism of 1054 that divided western and eastern Christianity. The Russian Orthodox Church in Moscow ha called the leader of the Ukrainian Church charlatan and schismatics, and President Vladimir Putin ha warned of possible bloodshed. Despite the snowy weather, hundred of people watched Monday’s service on a big screen outside because there wa not enough space in the packed cathedral to accommodate them. “This is the most happy day in the life of every Ukrainian. And I understand that every soul desire to be here,” Oksana Pasenok, a university professor, told Reuters. People formed a long queue after the service to see the decree, which will remain on public display. “Today the word of those holy father who died for Ukraine, for our freedom, for our liberty, come true,” said Oleksandr Sydoruk, engineer, standing in the queue to see the document. “Today, with this ‘Tomos’, our Ukrainian Church and Ukraine revive. And this is a day of joy for all Ukrainian Orthodox believers.” St Sophia Cathedral wa built by the son of Prince Volodymyr, whose baptism in 988 led to the spread of Christianity across what are now Ukraine and Russia.

Modi said last week his government wa determined to pas a bill in parliament to relax rule for Hindus and other non-Muslim minority from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan to become citizen of Hindu-majority India. Critics have called the bill, to be discussed in parliament on Tuesday, an attempt by Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to boost it Hindu voter base ahead of a national election due by May. The Asom Gana Parishad (AGP), based in the border state of Assam in India’s northeast, ha become the fourth ally to quit the ruling National Democratic Alliance in the past year, for a variety of reasons. Protests have erupted in recent month and on Monday in Assam, where a movement against illegal immigrants, of all religions, from Bangladesh ha simmered for decades, with some resident blaming them for eating into their resource and job opportunities. It is estimated that million of Bengali-speaking people in Assam trace their root to Muslim-majority Bangladesh, which won independence from Pakistan in 1971 with India’s help. “The home minister clearly told u they will try to get this bill passed tomorrow, so there’s no question u staying with the BJP anymore,” AGP President Atul Bora told reporter in New Delhi. The BJP ha the number in the Assam assembly to stay in power in the state despite the AGP pullout, but the regional party could help galvanise anger amongst many ethnic Assamese opposed to giving citizenship to migrant who came to India after 1971. That could hurt the BJP’s goal of sharply increasing it parliamentary seat from the northeast region of the country in the national election. At least two of the party that have left the BJP fold have already largely agreed to ally with the main opposition Congress, which hope to take on Modi a a united front and say the citizenship should not discriminate against Muslims. The BJP say it is in favour of institutionalising “constitutional, legislative and administrative safeguards” to the ethnic Assamese, but also want to give citizenship to Hindus from Bangladesh a the growth in the Hindu population of Assam had been overtaken by that of Muslims. “We’re trying to save Assam from Jinnah,” BJP leader and Assam minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said, referring to Pakistan founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah who wa instrumental in carving Muslim-dominated Pakistan out of India after winning independence from British colonial rule in 1947.',\n",

The sibling have publicly bickered since June 2017 over the future of the family home in which the late leader, who died in 2015, had lived for most of his life.

Average world surface air temperature were 14.7 Celsius (58.5 Fahrenheit) in 2018, just 0.2C off the highest, it said in the first global assessment based on full-year data. This year will also likely be hot, it scientist said. “Dramatic climatic event like the warm and dry summer in large part of Europe or the increasing temperature around the Arctic region are alarming sign to all of us,” said Jean-Noël Thépaut, head of Copernicus. Among other extreme in 2018, California and Greece suffered severe wildfires, Kerala in India had the worst flooding since the 1920s and heatwaves struck from Australia to North Africa. Around Antarctica, the extent of sea ice is at a record low at the start of 2019, according to the U.S. National Snow and Ice Data Center. Copernicus chief scientist Freja Vamborg said 2019 would also likely be hot. “We now have a nascent El Nino - it depends partly on what happens ... will it continue or die out?” she told Reuters. The last four year have seen the highest average temperature since record began in the 19th century - 2016 wa the hottest, boosted by an El Nino event that warmed the surface of the Pacific Ocean, ahead of 2017 and then 2015. The Copernicus report said that concentration of heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the atmosphere rose to a new record of 406.7 part per million (ppm) in 2018 from 404.1 in 2017, stoked largely by human burning of fossil fuels. And the average global temperature in the past five year wa 1.1C (2.0F) above pre-industrial times, it said. According to a U.N. climate report last year, temperature will rise 1.5C above pre-industrial time by mid-century on current trend - bringing the prospect of even more extreme weather. That U.N. report said government would have to make unprecedented cut in greenhouse gas to keep temperature below the 1.5C rise, which is the toughest goal set in the 2015 Paris Agreement. Almost 200 nation agreed a “rule book” to govern the Paris accord in talk in Poland last month, even though critic said it wa insufficient to prevent dangerous climate change. The Paris accord seek to end the fossil fuel era this century by shifting to cleaner energy such a wind and solar power. U.S. President Donald Trump plan to pull out and instead promote the U.S. fossil fuel industry.

       " 'Prime Minister Theresa May said on Sunday that Britain would be in uncharted territory if her Brexit deal is rejected by parliament later this month, despite little sign that she ha won over sceptical lawmakers. Britain is due to leave the European Union on March 29 but May’s inability so far to get her deal for a managed exit through parliament ha alarmed business leader and investor who fear the country is heading for a damaging no-deal Brexit. May said the vote in parliament would be around Jan. 15, a expected, contrary to report she could delay it. May ha already delayed the vote once, in December, when it became clear she would lose unless extra reassurance from the EU were agreed. Describing what would happen if she wa defeated, May told the BBC: “We’re going to be in uncharted territory. I don’t think anybody can say exactly what will happen in term of the reaction we’ll see in parliament.” Amid the uncertainty over Britain’s next step - which range from leaving without a deal to not leaving at all - a poll showed more Britons want to remain a member of the EU than leave, and voter want to make the final decision themselves. May’s party itself is divided over her deal, with many fearing that an insurance policy designed to avoid the re-emergence of a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland could leave Britain subject to EU rule indefinitely. One of those leading that opposition, lawmaker Jacob Rees-Mogg, said in a newspaper article that it wa “wishful thinking” that time away from parliament over the Christmas holiday could persuade him to change his mind and back the deal. The Northern Irish party that prop up May’s minority government called on her to stand firm in demanding that the EU change it “poison” backstop provision on Ireland’s post-Brexit border. With the parliamentary debate on her deal due to begin on Jan. 9, May said there wa still work to do to get reassurance over the backstop from the EU. She also promised parliament would have a greater say in the rest of the Brexit process and warned that rejecting her deal could prevent Britain’s exit. “Don’t let the search for the perfect become the enemy of the good, because the danger there is actually we end up with no Brexit at all,” May said. She did not answer whether she would, if defeated, make a second attempt to get the deal passed by parliament. May also did not directly respond, when asked, if she wa leading the country toward a no-deal Brexit. On Tuesday, her government could face a bid to block an unmanaged exit when a group of lawmaker try to amend budget legislation to deny funding for some no-deal preparation unless they are approved by parliament. It is unclear yet whether the amendment ha enough support to pass. May repeated her objection to holding a fresh public vote on the deal. She said a second referendum would be divisive, and also highlighted the lack of time available to hold a new referendum. “Practically, actually you couldn’t get a referendum in time before the 29th of March - you’d be talking about extending Article 50,” she said, referring to the two-year exit notice Britain sent to the EU in March 2017.',\n",

The vote is now due to take place the week beginning Jan. 14. To win, May and her minister will have to overcome opposition from across the political spectrum and defeat attempt to alter or delay the Brexit process or derail it altogether. Here’s how the voting will work: The debate take place in the lower house of parliament, the House of Commons. May doe not have an outright majority of the 650 lawmakers, and the DUP, the small Northern Irish party that usually prop up her government, is opposed to the deal. May need 318 vote to get a deal through parliament a seven Sinn Fein lawmaker do not sit, four speaker do not vote and the four teller are not counted. Parliament held three day of debate in December before the vote wa postponed. The debate is scheduled to restart next Wednesday. The government will propose a timetable for how many day it should last and when the vote will be. So far the government ha set out plan to hold the debate on Jan. 9 and 10. It ha also proposed continuing the debate on Jan. 11, although parliament is not due to sit that day. The December debate wa scheduled to last five days, so the restarted debate is expected to continue into the week of Jan. 14, when the government ha said the vote will be held. Each day can last up to eight hours, with start and finish time will vary from day to day. On the final day, there will be a series of votes: first, to approve or reject up to six amendment to the government’s motion, and then to approve or reject the motion. It is not yet clear what time the voting will start. The debate will be on whether to approve a motion stating that parliament ha approved the Withdrawal Agreement - a legal text setting out the term of departure - and a separate political declaration outlining the long-term relationship Britain will have with the EU. Lawmakers are able to put forward amendment to this motion. John Bercow, the Speaker of the House, chooses no more than six of these on the final day, and they will be voted on unless the proposer opt to withdraw them. If approved, an amendment would be included in final motion’s wording. While any successful amendment would not bind the government to comply with them, they would be politically hard to ignore, and could dictate May’s next steps. Ministers have expressed concern that if any amendment is passed by parliament, it could prevent the deal being ratified because the final vote may not then provide the legally necessary clear and unequivocal approval of May’s deal. The amendment will be voted on before the deciding ballot on whether to approve the overall motion - meaning May ha to win a series of votes, rather than just one, each with the potential to scupper her plan. Once the debate is finished, the speaker will typically ask those in favour of each amendment to shout “aye”, and then those against to say “no”. As long a some lawmaker shout “no”, the speaker will call a formal vote, known a a division. Votes are registered by lawmaker walking through different doorways, out of sight of television camera and onlookers. Once the headcount is complete - which can take up to 15 minute - lawmaker return to the debating chamber. Four appointed teller will assemble in front of the speaker, and one will read the result out loud. Once all the amendment have been voted upon, the main motion is put to a vote using the same process. By law, if the deal is rejected, minister have 21 day to state how they intend to proceed. The government ha previously said that if the agreement is rejected, Britain will leave the EU without a deal on March 29. The reality is that the huge uncertainty in the world’s fifth largest economy and the likely adverse reaction of financial market would demand a much quicker political reaction. Some medium have reported May would ask parliament to vote again on the deal. With 117 of her party’s 317 lawmaker having voted against her in a confidence vote in December, she is also likely to come under pressure to resign.',\n",

       " 'In the poor, hot region of Guatemala that wa home to a seven-year-old migrant girl before she died in U.S. border custody last month, palm oil cultivation is taking over from subsistence farming, adding to pressure on people to leave. Many villager around the municipality of Raxruha have sold land to palm oil producers, resident and local official say, helping to make Guatemala one of the world’s biggest exporter of the versatile product in the space of just a few years. Supporters of the industry say it ha created job and investment in an area where poverty and violence have long been the main driver of migration. But critic say farmer have given up land that long fed them, with many then entering a state of co-dependency with palm oil company that have become major employers, but do not pay well enough to stop people migrating. Cesar Castro, Raxruha’s mayor, said money raised from land sale had been used to pay people smugglers, a major factor in a surge in family leaving Guatemala. “These people get the money, and they go to the United States, and the vast majority come back to find more poverty and end up employed a worker on their own land,” Castro said. More than 50,000 Guatemalans were apprehended in family group at the U.S.-Mexico border in the 2018 fiscal year, more than double the year before, U.S. government data shows. Most get deported. Jakelin Caal, who died in U.S. custody after succumbing to a fever, left Raxruha with her father because he wa struggling to earn enough to support his family a a corn farmer, relative said. Smugglers tell family that having child with them can make it easier to enter the United States. While her father had not sold his land, others in the family have worked on palm plantation that surround their village. “The work’s a killer,” said Dorrian Caal, Jakelin’s uncle. “You have to get up at 3 a.m. and you get home at 10 at night, and with the little you’re paid, it’s not enough.” Dorrian said he earned 60 quetzales ($7.80) a day working from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. last year for local producer Industria Chiquibul, which ha been listed a a supplier by international commodity purchaser including ADM and Cargill . That would be below the 90 quetzales stipulated a the daily minimum wage for the agricultural sector in 2018. The National Council for Displaced People of Guatemala, a labour right group, lodged a complaint with Cargill about the wage in 2016. Local farmer Jose Maria Ical said the company agreed to raise it wage to 91 quetzales after repeated workers’ complaints. Chiquibul did not reply to repeated request for comment on this article. Questioned on Chiquibul, ADM said it set high standard for it supplier of palm oil, without making any specific reference to the company in it reply. “We take violation of our policy very seriously, and thoroughly investigate any allegation and take appropriate action a a result of those findings,” ADM spokeswoman Jackie Anderson said. Cargill said it “works closely with our supplier to ensure all palm supply chain practice support the United Nations’ goal to provide people with decent work. When issue are identified, we hold ourselves and our palm supplier responsible through a formal code of conduct to respond to concern and set time-bound action plan to address them.” Used in foodstuffs, detergent and fuels, palm oil is mostly produced in Indonesia and Malaysia, where environmental group are worried that it planting ha caused deforestation and habitat destruction. In the past few years, Guatemala ha become the biggest exporter in the Americas, according to Guatemalan palm oil industry association Grepalma. Exports leapt almost seven-fold in the last ten year to 727,000 tonne in 2017. Over one seventh of the area under cultivation in Guatemala is in Alta Verapaz, the remote, forested region where Raxruha lies. Traversed by dirt street without sidewalk or drains, the town is peopled by child and adult that sometimes walk barefoot, often living in cramped thatched dwellings. Farmer Ical related how he and others sold land to Chiquibul in 2010 in the Raxruha area when the firm purchased plot through intermediary who said they were ranchers. But access wa later blocked to farmers’ other allotment when Chiquibul’s land wa fenced off, he said. “They virtually obliged me to sell,” Ical added. Most of those who sold now work for the industry, he said. Some see the arrival of the palm oil industry a a positive development. Darlyn Lemus, a 30-year-old teacher, said the firm had taken undue flak. “There’s been a lot of speculation the palm industry ha forced them to sell, but it’s not like that, people have had their own reasons,” said Lemus, whose family is one of few in the area that have kept their lands. One palm oil company in Raxruha, NaturAceites, told Reuters most of the land it operates in Guatemala had been converted from “intensive cattle ranching.” Describing the industry a “the only chance of decent work there is in part of the country,” Hector Herrera, NaturAceites’ director of sustainability, said the firm had created thousand of jobs, invested in roads, school and health centres, and met all the labour standard required by law.',\n",
       " 'The former Catholic priest of the Polish village of Kalinowka is serving three year in jail for molesting five schoolgirls. But Marta Zezula, a mother whose testimony helped convict him, say the priest’s victim are the one made to feel guilty. “We are witch ... because we have pointed at the priest,” Zezula fumed a she shovelled straw into a chaff cutter in her barn in the tiny settlement in eastern Poland. Many parishioner believe she and other mother of those molested “simply convicted an innocent man”, she said. Home to about 170 people, Kalinowka is a short drive from the main road, but feel more remote. The Holy Cross church, built in 1880, sits on a hill overlooking rolling farmland and forest full of deer. Krystyna Kluzniak, hurrying into the well-kept church on a chilly November evening, said people should give the jailed priest a break. “The priest wa cool and we miss him,” she said. The priest, who cannot be named under Polish law, is now on trial again, charged with molesting another child. His lawyer, Marek Tokarczyk, said he denies the allegations. “We need a fair trial,” Tokarczyk said. Similar scandal have shaken the Catholic Church and split community in the United States, Ireland, Australia and elsewhere. But Poland is one of Europe’s most devout nations, where most people identify a Catholics and the Church is widely revered. Priests were active in the fight against communism and in 1989, led by a Polish pope, John Paul II, the Church helped overthrow Communist rule. Divisions over allegation of abuse are particularly stark here, said Marek Lisinski, the director of “Have no fear”, a group that advocate for victim of clerical abuse. Parishioners often side with priest and ostracise victim and their families, Lisinski told Reuters. In October, “Have no fear” published a map that revealed the scale of the issue. It used black cross to mark place where 60 priest had been convicted of abuse dating back to 1956. Afterwards, Lisinski said, people called in to report another 300 case of suspected abuse by priest which they had not raised with the Church or police for fear they would be doubted or shunned. The same month, a Polish court of appeal upheld a landmark ruling which granted a million zloty ($260,000) in compensation to a woman abused by a priest a a child. Jaroslaw Gluchowski, a lawyer in Poznan who represents victim of clerical abuse, said the ruling set an important precedent. “We’re now at a moment when all victim in Poland are realizing that they’re not alone,” he said. In a November statement, Poland’s bishop asked victim of clerical abuse for forgiveness and said the Church had begun collecting data to “identify the cause of these deed and ass their scale”. Archbishop Wojciech Polak, the primate of Poland, told Reuters the Church will publish it finding within six months. Polak encouraged victim of clerical abuse to talk to their bishops, who are “obliged to report to the prosecutors’ service all credible case they get knowledge of”. He said he wa aware the issue had caused rift in some communities. “It is the Church’s responsibility to act in a way that doesn’t create division but heals them,” he said. Senior bishop from around the world will meet Pope Francis at a conference in the Vatican in February to discus protection of minors. Conference organiser have said everyone must be held accountable or the Church risked losing credibility worldwide. The issue could also have political ramification in Poland, Lisinski and other observer say. The country is due to elect a new parliament by December 2019. The Catholic Church ha long played a major political role in Poland, making it 25,000 priest not only revered but also influential with voters. In December, a report appeared in Gazeta Wyborcza, a leading Polish daily, containing molestation allegation from a woman, Barbara Borowiecka, against the late priest Henryk Jankowski, an iconic figure in the anti-communist Solidarity movement. The mayor of Gdansk, the birthplace of Solidarity, asked the Church to investigate the allegations. Archbishop Polak told Reuters the Jankowski allegation “should be investigated for the good of the Church” and said it wa up to bishop of Gdansk to address them. The ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party won power in 2015 with a blend of patriotism and piety that echoed the religious nationalism of the Church. In October, a former PiS minister, Antoni Macierewicz, credited the Polish clergy with helping the party win local election that month. Joanna Scheuring-Wielgus, an MP for a small opposition party called Now, is seeking an independent inquiry into child abuse by priest because she say the Church cannot be relied upon to investigate itself. She say the idea ha received no support from PiS or other big parties. A PiS spokesperson did not respond to several request asking whether it supported the idea of an inquiry. Ryszard Czarnecki, a PiS MP for the European Parliament, responded to Reuters by asking why the Church should be singled out. “I don’t know why we are focusing on one group, a this also concern different group - for example, artistic or journalistic ones,” he said. About 12 million people, or almost a third of Poland’s population, regularly attend Mass, according to a survey by the Institute for Catholic Church Statistics, a Warsaw-based research centre. The number slightly declined from 2015 to 2016, the survey showed. Most child attend religious classes, but their number are dropping, too. In Lodz, Poland’s third-largest city, they fell from 80 percent in 2015 to fewer than 50 percent now, according to local government data quoted by the daily Dziennik Lodzki. In November, the Church said such trend could have dire consequences. “Abandoning the Catholic faith and the Christian principle governing our national life and state’s functioning” could lead to Poland’s collapse, it warned in a pastoral letter. In Kalinowka, Reuters spoke to seven parishioners. Most of them were sticking by the convicted priest. “I have a cousin whose son went to one of his class and they didn’t see it,” Wieslaw Solowiej, a pensioner, said outside the Kalinowka church. Jolanta Zych, whose nine-year-old daughter wa among those molested, said neighbour spurned the family. “I always greet people but some turn their face from me,” said Zych. The other mother Reuters spoke to, Zezula, said her daughter began refusing food after the court case. “She didn’t want to eat because one woman told her the priest wa in jail because of her.” During Mass, Zezula said, people shrank away or refused to shake hand during a ritual greeting known a the sign of peace. She no longer go to church. Piotr Lenart, the current priest, referred question to the Zamosc-Lubaczow Diocese in which the Kalinowka parish lies. Michal Maciolek, a priest and spokesman for the diocese, said it had offered the victim and their family pastoral and psychological help, but this had been rejected. No financial compensation wa offered, because “the diocese can’t take responsibility for the priest’s actions”.

       " 'Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi offered a rare acknowledgement of his close security cooperation with Israel in the Sinai peninsula during a U.S. television interview with CBS’ “60 Minutes” news programme broadcast on Sunday. The programme said Cairo had asked the network not to air the interview but did not give further details. Under Sisi, Egypt ha quietly cooperated with Israel on security in Egypt’s Sinai, a desert peninsula demilitarized a part of a U.S.-sponsored 1979 peace treaty between the two country but where Cairo’s force now operate freely. Acknowledging such cooperation with Israel can be a sensitive topic in Egypt. Asked whether the cooperation wa the closest and deepest that he ha had with Israel, Sisi responded: “That is correct.” “The Air Force sometimes need to cross to the Israeli side. And that’s why we have a wide range of coordination with the Israelis,” Sisi said, according to a transcript provided by CBS. Defeating militant in the Sinai and restoring security after year of unrest ha been a key promise of Sisi, who wa re-elected in March last year in a landslide victory against no real opposition. Islamist militant have been waging an insurgency for year in the north of the peninsula, which lack basic infrastructure and job opportunities. In contrast, the region’s southern coast is peppered with Red Sea tourist resorts. Egyptian security force have battled Islamist militant in the mainly desert region, stretching from the Suez Canal eastward to the Gaza Strip and Israel, since 2013. Asked why he had not managed to wipe the militant out, Sisi responded by pointing to the difficulty that the United States ha faced in Afghanistan against the Taliban insurgency. “Why hasn’t the U.S. eliminated the terrorist in Afghanistan after 17 year and spending a trillion dollars?” he asked. Sisi’s critic accuse him of cracking down on all dissent, but supporter say tough measure are needed to stabilise Egypt, which wa rocked by year of unrest after protest toppled veteran leader Hosni Mubarak in 2011. In his interview with “60 Minutes,” Sisi denied that Egypt wa holding political prisoners. CBS cited one right group’s estimate of 60,000 political prisoners. “I don’t know where they got that figure. I said there are no political prisoner in Egypt,” Sisi said. “Whenever there is a minority trying to impose their extremist ideology ... we have to intervene regardless of their numbers.”',\n",
       " 'The French government ha told Renault (RENA.PA) to provide more detail on compensation paid to senior executive via a Dutch holding company jointly owned with alliance partner Nissan, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Sunday. Le Maire made the demand after France’s CGT trade Union voiced concern over payment made to certain high-ranking executive via the alliance’s Renault-Nissan BV (RNBV) Dutch venture and called for more transparency at the carmaker. Corporate governance inside the alliance ha come under tight scrutiny after Japanese authority arrested it chairman Carlos Ghosn in mid November on suspicion of under-reporting his income at Nissan (7201.T). The French state is Renault’s biggest shareholder. Le Maire told CNews television that the government had written to Renault’s leadership to “request all detail necessary for full transparency on these compensation payments”. “I want to know who these payment were made to, if they were declared and therefore whether ... the Renault board wa aware of them.” A Renault spokesman did not immediately return call and message seeking comment. The Ghosn affair, sparked by a Nissan internal investigation, ha rocked the auto industry, strained Nissan’s tie with Renault and complicated diplomatic relation between Japan and the France. A one-time titan of the auto industry, Ghosn, who ha since been ousted a Nissan chairman, is also accused of aggravated breach of trust in transferring personal investment loss to Nissan. Ghosn denies all the charge against him. Renault board member including the French state’s representative have yet to be given full access to Nissan’s finding against Ghosn, which have been shared with Renault’s lawyers. The restriction are justified by judicial confidentiality, the company ha said. Executives from both carmaker - including Renault General Secretary Mouna Sepehri, who oversees communication with the board - had looked at least twice at legal way to pay Ghosn undisclosed income through RNBV or other shared finances, Reuters revealed last month. Those two effort were ultimately abandoned. Immediately after Ghosn’s Nov. 19 arrest, however, Nissan told Renault privately it wa extending it internal investigation to cover their Dutch-registered alliance holdings. Ghosn will make his first public appearance in seven week at a Tokyo court on Tuesday after he requested an open hearing for an explanation on his continued detention. Ghosn’s son, Anthony, told the Journal du Dimanche that Japanese prosecutor wanted his father to sign a confession..',\n",
       " 'Chancellor Angela Merkel’s junior coalition partners, the Social Democrats (SPD), demanded on Sunday that her interior minister quickly find out what Germany’s security agency knew about a huge data breach and how they reacted. The breach ha shocked Germany’s establishment and risk rocking Merkel’s awkward ‘grand coalition’ again just month after a row over the fate of the domestic intelligence agency chief came close to tearing apart the ruling alliance. The government said on Friday that personal data and document from hundred of German politician and public figure including Merkel had been published online, in what appeared to be one of Germany’s biggest data breaches. Lars Klingbeil, secretary general of the centre-left (SPD), told the Funke medium group the government must quickly shed light on “which agency knew what exactly when, and how that wa dealt with”. “This should be a priority for (Interior Minister) Horst Seehofer. It’s about protecting our democracy,” Klingbeil added. Seehofer told the Sueddeutsche Zeitung he only became aware of the breach on Friday morning, but that he would share everything he find out with the public and intended to do so by the middle of this week at the latest. The ecologist Greens leader in parliament, Anton Hofreiter, said the president of the BSI cyber defence agency, Arne Schoenbohm, must explain himself urgently in an extraordinary parliamentary committee meeting. The BSI on Saturday defended it role in responding to the data breach, saying it could not have connected individual case it wa aware of last year until the entire data release became public last week. Last year, Seehofer wa at the centre of a political storm over another security agency chief, whose the fate almost tore apart Merkel’s coalition of her conservative bloc and the SPD. Despite SPD resistance, Seehofer rescued Hans-Georg Maassen from dismissal in September when the domestic spy chief questioned the authenticity of video showing far-right nationalist chasing immigrant in the eastern city of Chemnitz. But Maassen wa subsequently sacked in November over a speech given behind closed door condemning “naive and leftist” government policies.

       " 'Nigerian soldier raided the office of the country’s Daily Trust newspaper and arrested two of it journalist following an article about the military’s fight against Islamist militant in the northeast, the newspaper said on Sunday. The Daily Trust published photograph on it website of armed soldier raiding it head office in the capital, Abuja. The newspaper also said the military had shut down it office in the northeastern city of Maiduguri after arresting a regional editor and a reporter. An uptick in attack by Islamist militant in recent month ha made security a key campaign issue ahead of the Feb. 16 presidential election in which Muhammadu Buhari will seek a second term. The Nigerian army said in an emailed statement that the paper, in an article published on Sunday, had “divulged classified military information, thus undermining national security”. It said the journalist were arrested in order for them to realise the importance of national security and that the military did not intend to silence the press. The statement wa issued hour after the presidency commented on the raids. “The Federal Government ha directed the military to vacate the premise of @daily_trust and the order ha been complied with,” the president’s spokesman, Garba Shehu, said on Twitter. “Issues between the military and the newspaper a they affect the coverage of the war in the Northeast will be resolved through dialogue,” he added. Also on Twitter, the main opposition party’s candidate, Atiku Abubakar, said press freedom wa the bedrock of Nigeria’s democracy and “nothing should be done to compromise it”. The Islamist militant group Boko Haram ha killed about 30,000 people since 2009 in an insurgency aimed at creating an Islamic caliphate in northeast Nigeria. It wa pushed out of most of the Belgium-sized swathe of territory it controlled in early 2015. But a faction that broke away in 2016 - Islamic State in West Africa (ISWA) - ha claimed responsibility in the past few month for a series of attack on military base and strategically located towns. The group attacked Baga - a town that border Niger, Chad and Cameroon - in December, forcing hundred to seek safety in Maiduguri, 200 km (125 miles) to the south. Opponents of Buhari - a military ruler in the 1980s who wa voted into office in 2015 - have criticised his security record, pointing to such incident and an attack on an army base in Metele, Borno state, in which about 100 soldier were killed.',\n",
       " 'Jamal al-Badawi, wanted by the United States for his suspected role in the attack on the USS Cole 18 year ago, wa killed in a precision strike in Yemen on Jan. 1, U.S. Central Command said on Sunday. Badawi wa indicted by a federal grand jury in 2003 over his role in the October 2000 deadly bombing of the USS Cole, a Navy guided-missile destroyer. He escaped from prison in Yemen twice, once in 2003 and again in 2006. “U.S. force confirmed the result of the strike following a deliberate assessment process,” said Central Command spokesman Captain Bill Urban, two day after the Defense Department said U.S. force had targeted Badawi in the strike. It is the latest blow to Yemen’s al Qaeda branch, known a Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), which ha lost key leader in U.S strike in recent years. In 2018, U.S. official said they believed that Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri, once one of the world’s most feared bombmakers, had been killed. Still, Katherine Zimmerman at the American Enterprise Institute conservative thinktank cautioned that AQAP had proven it will remain a threat. The group ha benefited from the chaos of Yemen’s civil war, although it ha lost major strongholds, including the port city of Mukallah. “There is certainly a degradation of the leadership,” Zimmerman said. “The big concern is that al Qaeda ha always proven that it bench is much deeper and there is no clear strategy for stabilizing Yemen and setting the condition where we don’t have a new generation (of militants) coming forward.” Yemen’s conflict ha pushed it to the verge of famine, with million relying on food aid. The death of Badawi remove perhaps the last major figure in the USS Cole attack from the battlefield. U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted: “Our GREAT MILITARY ha delivered justice for the hero lost and wounded in the cowardly attack on the USS Cole.” There wa a $5 million reward for information leading to his arrest. The Cole attack wa a devastating blow to the U.S. Navy.

       " 'Former Venezuelan Supreme Court Justice Christian Zerpa ha fled to the United States to protest President Nicolas Maduro’s second term that will begin with his inauguration this week, the onetime Maduro backer told a Miami broadcaster on Sunday. The latest defection from the crisis-stricken OPEC nation’s government come amid growing international pressure on Maduro over his new term, which resulted from a broadly boycotted 2018 vote dismissed by country around the world a a sham. “I’ve decided to leave Venezuela to disavow the government of Nicolas Maduro,” Zerpa said in an interview with EVTV, which is broadcast over cable and the internet. “I believe (Maduro) doe not deserve a second chance because the election he supposedly won wa not free and competitive.” The Supreme Court confirmed in a statement that he had fled, referring to him a a former magistrate and adding it opened an investigation of him in November over accusation of sexual harassment by woman in his office. The court’s leadership recommended that he be dismissed over the allegations, it said, without providing details. Zerpa wa for year a crucial ally of Maduro on the Supreme Court, which ha backed the ruling Socialist Party in every major legal dispute since Maduro’s 2013 election. He wrote a 2016 ruling that provided the legal justification for Maduro’s government to strip congress of most of it power after the Socialist Party lost control of the body to the opposition in a landslide election. Zerpa in the interview described the Supreme Court a “an appendage of the executive branch,” and said that justice were at time summoned to the presidential palace to receive instruction on how to rule on certain sensitive cases. The Information Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Zerpa said he did not criticise Maduro’s May 2018 election to make sure he could pave the way for a safe exit from the country in the company of his family. Opposition leader have urged foreign government not to recognise Maduro after his inauguration on Thursday, and a group of Latin American nation on Friday called on Maduro not to take office. But diplomat consulted by Reuters said few country were likely to shutter embassy or sever tie with Venezuela.

       " 'White House national security adviser John Bolton added a new condition on Sunday to the U.S. withdrawal from Syria, saying Turkey must agree to protect the United States’ Kurdish allies. President Donald Trump’s abrupt decision to announce a U.S. pullout from Syria left many question open, chiefly whether Kurdish fighter who had been operating in northern Syria alongside U.S. force would now be attacked by their long-time enemy, Turkey. Bolton, on a trip to Israel and Turkey, said he would stress in talk with Turkish officials, including President Tayyip Erdogan, that Kurdish force must be protected. Ahead of talk with Israeli officials, he told reporter the pullout would be done in a way that guaranteed the Islamic State jihadist group “is defeated and is not able to revive itself and become a threat again.” And it would be carried out in such a way a to “make sure that the defence of Israel and our other friend in the region is absolutely assured, and to take care of those who have fought with u against ISIS and other terrorist groups.” Asked whether a U.S. withdrawal would not take place in Syria until Turkey guaranteed the Kurdish fighter would be safe, Bolton said: “Basically, that’s right.” The Syrian YPG militia ha been highly effective in the war against Islamic State, a part of the wider Syrian conflict pitting a range of insurgent group against President Bashar al-Assad’s force and sometimes against each other. But Turkey ha long castigated Washington for it military relationship with the YPG. Ankara regard the YPG an extension of the PKK, a Kurdish armed group that ha waged an insurgency in southeast Turkey for over three decades. “We don’t think the Turks ought to undertake military action that’s not fully coordinated with and agreed to by the United States at a minimum,” Bolton said, “so they don’t endanger our troops, but also so that they meet the president’s requirement that the Syrian opposition force that have fought with u are not endangered.” The YPG ha indicated that it might seek a deal with Damascus after the U.S. force have gone. Bolton, who will travel to Turkey on Monday, said the United States would talk to Ankara to find out what it objective and capability were. Erdogan’s spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said Turkey’s target were the YPG, the PKK and Islamic State. “One aim of Turkey’s fight against the PKK and it Syrian extension is to rescue the Kurds from the cruelty and oppression of this terrorist group,” state-owned Anadolu news agency quoted Kalin a saying, in comment that emerged after Bolton made his remarks. “Turkey will continue decisively it effort to end the war, provide security, and implement the process of political transition without discriminating between our Syrian brother on the basis of religion, ethnicity or sect,” Kalin said. In Washington on Sunday, Trump reiterated that the United States would be pulling it troop out of Syria but suggested the move might not happen soon. “I never said we are doing it that quickly. But we are decimating ISIS,” Trump told reporters.

       " 'An offensive by Mexico’s new government against fuel theft at one of the country’s main refinery ha led to day of shortage at gas station in several central states, a authority move more fuel by tanker and le by vulnerable pipelines. A Reuters witness said many gas station in the city of Guadalajara in Jalisco state were closed on Sunday, including those operated by state oil firm Pemex, Spain’s Repsol and BP. There were long line of motorist at those that were operating. “I’ve gone to 10 gas station and nothing, there’s none at any of them,” said Alan Delgado, trying to fill his Buick truck at a BP gas station in Guadalajara. “This is a serious and critical situation because it complicates work and businesses.” The shortage followed the closure of a pipeline from the Salamanca refinery in the central state of Guanajuato, and a Pemex started using more tanker to transport fuel. Theft by gang and oil industry worker from Mexico’s state-controlled refinery is a major drain on government resources, but the measure taken to tackle the crime could also weigh on the economy if shortage drag on. Violent criminal gang have for year used fuel theft a a way to supplement their income, bleeding money from state coffer and driving bloodshed a they fight rival and extort oil workers. President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who took office in December, confirmed on Friday that le fuel wa being sent through pipelines. “I ask citizen for understanding and support, because we need to solve this problem together. We are trying to get it resolved soon,” Lopez Obrador said in a televised speech. Obrador ha vowed to tackle theft “outside and inside” Pemex, or Petroleos Mexicanos [PEMX.UL], which estimate that fuel worth more than 146 billion peso ($7.40 billion) ha been stolen since 2016 alone. The president said last month that Mexico’s armed force would take part in security at Pemex installation around the country, including it refinery in Salamanca. Fuel theft there ha been linked to a surge in violence, according to Guanajuato state governor Diego Sinhue. The Mexican Association of Gasoline Station business owner warned it member on Jan. 3 that no fuel wa being transported via the pipeline from the Salamanca refinery. “You are free to take measure that benefit your customers, to limit the sale (of fuel) to 10 liter per car or whatever you consider necessary to serve the public,” the association said. Guanajuato governor Sinhue took to Twitter on Sunday, saying that Pemex’s chief executive Octavio Romero “confirmed that after reopening the Salamanca-Leon pipeline, he expects to reestablish service to 100 percent of the gasoline station during the day.” It wa not immediately clear whether opening that pipeline would reduce shortage in other regions. Pemex said on Saturday that it is “preferring the use of safer mean of transport, which mean change in the logistics for delivery to service stations,” leading to delay in the state of Hidalgo, Mexico, Jalisco, Michoacan, Guanajuato and Queretaro. Pemex said it is aiming to boost distribution in the affected state by up to 20 percent, transporting fuel by tanker truck and trains. A May 2017 study commissioned by the national energy regulator found that thieves, between 2009 and 2016, had tapped pipeline roughly every 1.4 km (0.86 miles) along Pemex’s approximately 14,000 km pipeline network. The government ha not made clear if they see road and rail transport a a long term solution for fuel distribution. Transporting fuel by road and rail is 12 to 16 time more expensive than by pipeline, said Gonzalo Monroy, a Mexico City-based oil analyst. “If this keep happening and expanding to other part of the country, the Mexican economy is going to have a very tough first quarter,” said Monroy.

It wa not immediately clear what prompted the advice to medium organisations, but WikiLeaks singled out Britain’s Guardian newspaper for publishing what it said wa a false report about Assange. The Guardian did not immediately respond late on Sunday to a Reuters request for comment. The Australian set up WikiLeaks a a channel for publishing confidential information from anonymous sources. He is a hero to some for exposing what supporter cast a government abuse of power and for championing free speech, but to others he is a rebel who ha undermined the security of the United States. WikiLeaks angered Washington by publishing hundred of thousand of secret U.S. diplomatic cable that laid bare often highly critical U.S. appraisal of world leader from Russian President Vladimir Putin to member of the Saudi royal family. “There is a pervasive climate of inaccurate claim about WikiLeaks and Julian Assange, including purposeful fabrication planted in large and otherwise ‘reputable’ medium outlets,” Wikileaks said an email sent to medium organisation and marked “Confidential legal communication. Not for publication.” “Consequently journalist and publisher have a clear responsibility to carefully fact-check from primary source and to consult the following list to ensure they are not spreading, and have not spread, defamatory falsehood about WikiLeaks or Julian Assange.” WikiLeaks did not respond to repeated request for comment. The 5,000-word email included 140 statement that WikiLeaks said were false and defamatory, such a the assertion that Assange had ever been an “agent or officer of any intelligence service”. WikiLeaks also said it wa false and defamatory to suggest that Assange, 47, had ever been employed by the Russian government or that he is, or ha ever been, close to the Russian state, the Kremlin or Putin. Other item listed a false and defamatory included more personal claim including that Assange bleach his hair, that he is a hacker, that he ha ever neglected an animal or that he ha poor personal hygiene. Assange made international headline in early 2010 when WikiLeaks published a classified U.S. military video showing a 2007 attack by Apache helicopter that killed a dozen people in Baghdad, including two Reuters news staff. Later that year, the group released over 90,000 secret document detailing the U.S.-led military campaign in Afghanistan, followed by almost 400,000 internal U.S. military report detailing operation in Iraq. More than 250,000 classified cable from U.S. embassy followed, then almost 3 million dating back to 1973.',\n",

       " 'The Palestinian Authority said on Sunday it had ordered it employee to pull out from the Gaza-Egypt border crossing, effectively closing the main exit point from the impoverished Gaza Strip. The dispute over the border stem from a rift between the PA, based in the occupied West Bank and headed by Western-backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, and the Islamist militant group Hamas, which took control of Gaza more than a decade ago in a civil war. Re-opening the Rafeh crossing, which according to human right group is the sole exit point from Gaza for an estimated 95 percent of it 2 million population, will require Egypt to agree on a new operator. It is unclear whether it will allow Hamas to run the passage. Cairo ha not so far commented on the situation. PA employee were deployed to Gaza’s border crossing with Israel and Egypt in 2017 under Egyptian mediation in what wa seen a the first concrete step towards ending the dispute. The PA said Sunday’s decision to pull out from the crossing wa a response to Hamas undermining it operation and detaining some of it workers. “After Hamas’s insistence on bolstering division ... and the questioning, detention and suppression of our employees, we have become convinced it is useless to maintain our presence there,” it said. The decision take effect on Monday, though the crossing wa already scheduled to be closed until Tuesday due to a holiday. Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum told Reuters the closure of the border amounted to “additional sanction by Abbas against the people of Gaza”. “This is a blow to... Egypt, which had overseen the handover of the crossing a part of the implementation of the reconciliation deal that Abbas ha destroyed,” he said. Poverty is rampant in Gaza due to an Israeli-Egyptian blockade and three armed confrontation with Israel since 2008, a well a the internal rivalry.

       " 'Preliminary result from Democratic Republic of Congo’s tumultuous presidential election will be delayed past Sunday’s deadline, the head of the election commission told Reuters. The commission, known a CENI, had received only 47 percent of vote tally sheet a of Saturday, said it president, Corneille Nangaa, and it wa not yet clear when the result would be ready. The delay is the latest setback in a disorganised poll to pick a successor to President Joseph Kabila, who ha ruled the country of 80 million people since his father wa assassinated in 2001. The Dec. 30 vote could mark Congo’s first democratic transition of power since independence from Belgium in 1960. But tension rose after observer reported a litany of irregularity that the opposition say are part of the ruling party’s effort to steal the election. The opposition, represented by it two main candidate Martin Fayulu and Felix Tshisekedi, and the ruling coalition all say their candidate have won. “It will not be possible to announce the result tomorrow,” Nangaa said. A CENI spokesman later said that the commission wa holding a meeting on Sunday to decide when they will be announced. Worried that dispute and delay could spark the kind of violence seen after the 2006 and 2011 elections, the United Nations Security Council met on Friday to discus how to react, but wa unable to reach an agreement, according to an internal report seen by Reuters. The United States condemned a lack of transparency in the contest, while China, a major investor, lauded the process. “Tensions were mounting while the CENI tabulated the results, notably in light of posturing by party and candidates,” Leila Zerrougui, head of the UN Stabilization Mission in Democratic Republic of Congo, told the meeting, according to the internal report. But the 15 council member “differed in their appreciation of the problem that beset the process and were divided over the question of whether the Council should issue a press statement”, the report went on to say. A negative international reaction could be problematic for Kabila, whose government ha defended the election’s organisation, and could weaken the legitimacy of Kabila’s hand-picked successor, Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, should he be declared winner. In the meeting, France pushed for the publication of a statement that recognised that Congo’s election had allowed people to exercise their democratic right and called for calm, but criticised the government’s decision to cut access to the Internet and some medium outlets. The United States, which ha threatened to impose sanction against those who undermine the election process and ha deployed troop to Gabon in case it citizen need rescuing from any violence, backed the statement, alongside Britain, Ivory Coast, Belgium and others. South Africa, long a Kabila ally, said the statement could “inflame” the situation if issued before the results, the report said. Russia said it could be seen a an attempt to skew public opinion. China “lauded the manner in which election were conducted”, the report said, and said a statement should not be published before the results. Congo’s Catholic church body, CENCO, said this week that it had identified the victor based on it own tally collected by 40,000 observers, though it did not name the winner. The declaration wa widely seen a a warning to authority against rigging the vote.

       " 'U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Democrats would pas new legislation to try to reopen part of the government next week after talk between the Trump administration and Democratic negotiator on Saturday failed to end a two-week partial government shutdown. President Donald Trump is demanding $5.6 billion to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico but Democrats in control of the House of Representatives this week passed a bill to reopen the government without providing additional funding for the wall. Trump say he will not sign the bill until he get the money for the wall. After a meeting aimed at breaking the deadlock failed on Saturday, Pelosi said House Democrats would seek to reopen government agency next week through piecemeal appropriation bills, starting with the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service. “This action is necessary so that the American people can receive their tax refund on schedule,” she said. Vice President Mike Pence led the administration’s team in the meeting with Democratic negotiator on Saturday. He said it wa “productive” but an aide said there wa no in-depth discussion of a possible compromise level of funding for border security. The two side agreed to meet again on Sunday. A Democratic aide familiar with the meeting said Democratic staffer urged the administration to reopen the government, arguing that progress on the contentious issue of border security would be difficult while the government wa closed. The aide said the administration instead “doubled down on their partisan proposal that led to the Trump shutdown in the first place.” With the two side sticking to their positions, a quarter of the federal government ha been closed for two weeks, leaving 800,000 public worker unpaid. Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and a senior adviser, also attended the meeting at the White House, along with Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. They were negotiating with senior staff for the top Democrats in Congress, Representative Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer. Pelosi, who took over a House speaker this week following Democratic victory at mid-term election in November, ha said Trump’s proposed wall is “immoral” and a “waste of money.” A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll showed that 50 percent of the public blame Trump for the shutdown and 7 percent blame Republican lawmakers, against 32 percent who blame Democrats. Still, Trump reiterated his demand for a border wall in a series of tweet on Saturday. “The Democrats could solve the Shutdown problem in a very short period of time,” Trump said. “All they have to do is approve REAL Border Security (including a Wall), something which everyone, other than drug dealers, human trafficker and criminals, want very badly!” Trump threatened on Friday to take the step of using emergency power to build the wall without Congress’ approval. Such a move would almost certainly be met with legal challenges. The funding bill passed by Democrats on Jan. 3 included $1.3 billion for border fencing and $300 million for other border security item including technology and cameras. Trump ha in recent day backed away from his earlier insistence that it be a concrete wall on the border, saying a steel fence would work just a well, but he ha stuck to his demand of $5.6 billion.',\n",

       " 'The Roman Catholic archbishop of Lyon go on trial on Monday charged with failing to act on historical allegation of sexual abuse of boy scout by a priest in his diocese. Cardinal Philippe Barbarin is the highest-profile cleric to be caught up in the paedophile scandal inside the Catholic Church in France, and will stand trial alongside five others from his diocese. While most of the recent focus in the Church’s global abuse crisis ha been on Australia and Chile, Barbarin’s trial put the spotlight on Europe’s senior clergy again, just a Pope Francis prepares to host a meeting of senior bishop from around the world in Rome next month to discus the protection of minors. Barbarin is accused of failing to report allegation of sexual abuse in the 1980s and early 1990s by Father Bernard Preynat - a priest who ha admitted sexual abuse, according to his lawyer, and is due to go on trial later this year. The charge carry a potential three-year prison sentence and fine of up to about $50,000. Barbarin told the newspaper Le Monde in August 2017 that he had never concealed allegation against Preynat, but acknowledged shortcoming in his handling of them. “I myself realise that my response at the time wa inadequate,” he said. Barbarin’s lawyer, Jean-Felix Luciani, said he expected Barbarin to be acquitted. “He’s accused of covering up for Preynat, whereas in fact it wa Barbarin who triggered this whole process,” Luciani said. “You don’t repair one injustice with another.” Barbarin told Le Monde in 2017 that he had previously opened an investigation of Preynat under church or canon law because a judicial investigation wa moving so slowly. Barbarin, who moved to the Lyon diocese in 2002, ha said he became aware of Preynat’s activity in 2007. He eventually removed the priest from his post in 2015. Barbarin told Le Monde that he had suspended two other priest and called in the judiciary “when I learned of allegation of recent abuses, in 2006 and 2014”. But faced with allegation of abuse said to have taken place 15 or 20 year earlier, he said he “knocked on doors” for advice, but received no satisfactory answer. Lyon prosecutor had previously investigated Barbarin but dropped the probe in the summer of 2016 without a detailed explanation. However, an association of alleged victim called Parole Liberee (“Freed Word”) used a provision of French law to compel the cardinal to stand trial. Pope Francis ha come under fire over the Church’s handling of the spreading sexual abuse crisis. In September, researcher said they had found indication of sexual abuse in Germany by 1,670 Catholic cleric over the course of seven decades. On Friday, the Vatican said an Argentine bishop working in a top Vatican financial department wa under preliminary investigation for sexual abuse. Pope Francis himself met Barbarin in early 2016, and later told the Catholic newspaper La Croix that it would make no sense for the cardinal to resign before any eventual trial. “According to the information at my disposal, Cardinal Barbarin took the appropriate measures, he took thing in hand. He is brave, creative, a missionary,” Francis wa quoted a saying.',\n",
       " 'The main Turkish-backed rebel army ha deployed along frontlines close to jihadist in northwest Syria to repel any new militant advance after an offensive that expanded their control over the country’s last rebel-held bastion, rebel and resident said. Islamist Tahrir al Sham, formerly affiliated to al Qaeda, on Sunday entered the town of Atareb, day after capturing from their mainstream rival the strategic town of Darat Izza, both in the western Aleppo countryside, in a military campaign that ha since spread across Idlib and area near the Turkish border. A convoy of Tahrir al Sham fighter entered the densely populated town after forcing it leader to hand over control by threatening to storm it if mainstream rebel opposed to their hardline Islamist ideology do not leave. The offensive by Tahrir al Sham ha alarmed the National Army, the main Turkish-backed rebel force aimed at unifying disparate faction in the northwest. “We took a decision to repel the aggression by Tahrir al Sham on the Aleppo and Idlib countryside,” their spokesman Major Youssef Hamoud said. “We are reinforcing area to prevent their expansion and control of more village and towns.” The National Army compromise about 35,000 fighter from some of the biggest faction in a war that ha killed hundred of thousand of people and forced 11 million people from their home over the last seven years. The jihadist have been the dominant force in rebel-held Idlib province and also have a civil administration that run basic service in many town including Idlib city, the provincial capital. Ideological difference divide them from nationalist group in the Free Syrian Army gathered under the banner of the National Army and the National Liberation Front (NLF), both backed by Turkey. The rebel cause to topple President Bashar al-Assad ha been plagued by turf war and local rivalries. “Tahrir al Sham seek to end the presence of the NLF and control all of Idlib,” Hamoud said. He echoed the view of military expert that the territorial gain would help widen the jihadists’ grip over a strip along the northern border with Turkey to their stronghold further south in the western Aleppo countryside. Hamoud also accused the jihadist of attempting to divert their force from any Turkish army campaign to seize the city of Manbij and Arab town located east of the Euphrates River, controlled by the Syrian Kurdish YPG militias. President Donald Trump’s abrupt decision to announce a U.S. pull-out from Syria ha left open many questions, chiefly whether Kurdish fighter operating in northern Syria would now be targeted by their long-time enemy Turkey.

       " 'Southeast Asian country should be cautious in negotiating with China on it flagship Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to avoid being trapped in unsustainable debt, 70 percent of respondent said in a policy survey released on Monday. Southeast Asia is increasingly sceptical of U.S. commitment to the region a a strategic partner and a source of security, while China’s reach is seen a growing both politically and economically, the study also showed. “The conventional wisdom that China hold sway in the economic realm while the United States wields it influence in the political-strategic domain will ... need to be revisited in light of the survey results,” it said. The survey by the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, affiliated with the Singapore government, polled 1,008 respondent from all ten nation of the ASEAN grouping, drawn from government, academic and business communities, civil society and the media. Nearly half of the respondent said President Xi Jinping’s hallmark Belt and Road initiative would bring ASEAN “closer into China’s orbit,” while a third said the project lacked transparency and 16 percent predicted it would fail. A large majority, or 70 percent, said their government “should be cautious in negotiating BRI projects, to avoid getting into unsustainable financial debt with China,” a view strongest in Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand. Some Western government have accused China of pulling country into a debt trap with the initiative, an accusation China ha denied. China wa seen by 73 percent of the respondent a having the greatest economic influence in the region and wa also believed to have more influence politically and strategically than the United States. Six out of ten respondent said U.S. influence globally had deteriorated from a year ago and two-thirds believed U.S. engagement with Southeast Asia declined. About a third said they had little or no confidence in the U.S. a a strategic partner and provider of regional security. Fewer than one in 10 saw China a “a benign and benevolent power,” with nearly a half saying Beijing possessed “an intent to turn Southeast Asia into it sphere of influence”. The study’s author wrote, “This result ... is a wake-up call for China to burnish it negative image across Southeast Asia despite Beijing’s repeated assurance of it benign and peaceful rise.” There wa a call for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to play a more active role in Myanmar’s Rohingya crisis, although a majority of the respondent sought mediation rather than diplomatic pressure. The United Nations say 730,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled from Myanmar’s Rakhine State to Bangladesh since the military’s crackdown on insurgent attacks. U.N.-mandated investigator have accused Myanmar’s military of carrying out killings, gang rape and arson with “genocidal intent,” an allegation the military ha denied.',\n",
       " 'The spiritual leader of Orthodox Christians worldwide on Sunday presented the head of the Ukrainian church with a decree granting it independence from Moscow, a historic split strongly opposed by Russia. Ukraine see the break a vital to it security and independence, but it is bound to aggravate the wider conflict between the two countries. Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, who signed the autocephaly decree on Saturday, handed the document to Ukrainian Metropolitan Epifaniy at St George’s Cathedral in Istanbul after a mass to mark the feast of Epiphany. “Unity ha been restored. Now we are united,” Epifaniy told the congregation, standing with Bartholomew at the front of the crowded church, both wearing ceremonial robe and holding staffs. The 39-year-old Epifaniy wa chosen to head the new church last month. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, who also attended the event, compared the development to Ukraine’s referendum for independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Russia bitterly opposes the split, comparing it to the Great Schism of 1054 that divided western and eastern Christianity. President Vladimir Putin ha warned of possible bloodshed. “We ask you, mother church and all church to pray for peace in Ukraine,” Epifaniy said, adding Ukrainian people had been suffering for five year from a war “brought from outside”. Relations between Ukraine and Russia collapsed after Moscow’s seizure of Crimea in 2014. Ukraine imposed martial law in November, citing the threat of a full-scale invasion after Russia captured three of it vessel in the Kerch Strait. The patriarchate, the seat of the spiritual leader of some 300 million Orthodox Christians worldwide, endorsed Ukraine’s request for the new church in October. “God ha heard our prayers,” Poroshenko said in an address on Ukrainian television after the handover of the decree, or tomos. “Tomos for Ukraine is actually another act of declaring the country’s independence.” The pro-Western Poroshenko lobbied hard for the church’s creation. He face a tight election race in March and it may give him a boost. He will take part in a service in Kiev on Monday at the St Sophia Cathedral, now a museum only used for major religious events. The decree will be displayed at the cathedral for the public to view from Monday, the church said. The Ukrainian Orthodox church ha been beholden to Moscow for hundred of years, and Ukraine’s leader see church independence a vital to tackling Russian meddling. Kiev say Moscow-backed church on it soil are a Kremlin tool to spread propaganda and support separatist in the eastern Donbass region in a conflict that ha killed more than 10,000 people. The church strongly deny this. Religious division deepened in Ukraine after 2014 and two Orthodox faction vie for dominance. The church known a the Moscow Patriarchate, aligned with the Russian Orthodox Church, see itself a the only legitimate church in Ukraine. On Dec. 20, Ukrainian MPs passed a law that could force the church to add “Russian” to it name. The rival Kiev Patriarchate wa born after the collapse of the Soviet Union and it popularity ha grown since 2014. It favour European integration and championed the independent church but the Moscow Patriarchate denounces it a schismatic.

       " 'Chancellor Angela Merkel’s junior coalition partners, the Social Democrats (SPD), demanded on Sunday that her interior minister quickly find out what Germany’s security agency knew about a huge data breach and how they reacted. The breach ha shocked Germany’s establishment and risk rocking Merkel’s awkward ‘grand coalition’ again just month after a row over the fate of the domestic intelligence agency chief came close to tearing apart the ruling alliance. The government said on Friday that personal data and document from hundred of German politician and public figure including Merkel had been published online, in what appeared to be one of Germany’s biggest data breaches. Lars Klingbeil, secretary general of the centre-left (SPD), told the Funke medium group the government must quickly shed light on “which agency knew what exactly when, and how that wa dealt with”. “This should be a priority for (Interior Minister) Horst Seehofer. It’s about protecting our democracy,” Klingbeil added. Seehofer told the Sueddeutsche Zeitung he only became aware of the breach on Friday morning, but that he would share everything he find out with the public and intended to do so by the middle of this week at the latest. The ecologist Greens leader in parliament, Anton Hofreiter, said the president of the BSI cyber defence agency, Arne Schoenbohm, must explain himself urgently in an extraordinary parliamentary committee meeting. The BSI on Saturday defended it role in responding to the data breach, saying it could not have connected individual case it wa aware of last year until the entire data release became public last week. Last year, Seehofer wa at the centre of a political storm over another security agency chief, whose the fate almost tore apart Merkel’s coalition of her conservative bloc and the SPD. Despite SPD resistance, Seehofer rescued Hans-Georg Maassen from dismissal in September when the domestic spy chief questioned the authenticity of video showing far-right nationalist chasing immigrant in the eastern city of Chemnitz. But Maassen wa subsequently sacked in November over a speech given behind closed door condemning “naive and leftist” government policies.

       " 'Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Friday sought to ease market concern that the U.S. central bank wa ignoring sign of an economic slowdown, saying he wa aware of the risk and would be patient and flexible in policy decision this year. Speaking after month of volatility in world bond and stock markets, Powell avoided some of the communication misstep that in the past have roiled rather than calmed investors. He also pledged to stay in his job even if asked to quit by President Donald Trump, who ha been critical of him. Echoing a more sympathetic tone recently espoused by some of his colleagues, Powell said the Fed wa “listening” to market and would balance the steady flow of strong economic data against the array of risk - from slowing global growth to worry about the U.S.-China trade war - that have spooked investors. The message wa heard on Wall Street, where major stock index surged about 3.5 percent to a more than two-week high. The market bounce came after a volatile December selloff in which trader grew increasingly sceptical of the Fed’s upbeat forecast and plan to keep hiking interest rate in 2019. “Particularly with the muted inflation reading that we’ve seen coming in, we will be patient a we watch to see how the economy evolves,” Powell told the American Economic Association in Atlanta. The Fed, which hiked benchmark U.S. interest rate four time last year including in December, is however not on a preset path and could pause policy tightening a it did in 2016 when global growth concern led to doubt about the U.S. economic recovery, he said. “We are always prepared to shift the stance of policy and to shift it significantly” if needed, Powell said, speaking on a panel alongside former Fed chief Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke. That flexibility, he added, applied a well to the monthly reduction to the Fed’s balance sheet. The Fed chief stressed that the economy remained on track and that the job market wa quite strong. He did not address Fed forecast from December that sketched out two more rate rise this year, but, combined with the message of Fed president who in recent day downplayed that tightening plan, he delivered the sort of temperate message investor had hoped to hear. “We really need to be looking at the data and having the economy tell us, do we need to move more? Do we need to move more, faster? Can we wait?,” Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank President Loretta Mester said in an interview with Reuters. “We should take our time and ass ... We may be where we need to be.” Her comments, from a sometimes hawkish Fed official, highlighted the change in tone at a central bank that, after two year of roughly quarterly rate increases, wa now assessing the risk of going too far. Following Powell’s remarks, Treasury yield rose and future trader began pricing in a small chance of a rate hike this year, versus no chance seen before Powell began speaking. Compared to comment he made after the Fed raised rate last month, “it’s not that he’s changed his message ... but that he explained it more patiently and in greater detail,” said Lou Brien, market strategist at DRW Trading in Chicago. Powell’s appearance in Atlanta wa his first since last month’s rate increase and a public lashing from Trump, who according to source asked aide about his power to fire the Fed chairman. The head of the Fed, once confirmed by the Senate, can only be removed “for cause”, not a policy disagreement. Powell responded with a terse “No” when asked if he would resign if Trump requested him to do so. The recent market turbulence ha posed a dilemma for the Fed, a a seeming loss of confidence in financial market about the U.S. economy’s prospect wa offset by upbeat data from the real economy, including a strong December job report. The Labor Department reported on Friday that 312,000 job were created last month, well above market expectations. Wages and labour force participation both rose, signalling sustained economic strength. Powell called the job report “very strong,” with U.S. data “on track to sustain good momentum into the new year.” The world’s biggest economy expanded well above potential last year and, along with U.S. consumers, is expected to remain strong through this year. Yet sign are growing that Trump’s tit-for-tat trade war with China is taking a toll: this week, tech giant Apple and grain trader Cargill warned about weaker sale in China. Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said on Thursday that planned rate hike should be halted for now, while on Friday Mester said she see only one or two rate hike this year. A third Fed president, Thomas Barkin of Richmond, said he is hearing more concern about economic risk and trade. “The market are feeling better that the Fed is not strangling the overall economy and perhaps forcing it into a recession, and that remove a monetary policy concern that ha been hanging over the market for the past few months,” said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist and senior portfolio manager at SlateStone Wealth LLC. The Fed’s tightening cycle includes both rate hike and the gradual shedding of it more than $4 trillion (3 trillion pounds) in assets. Powell said he did not think the latter wa having much impact on markets, but that the strategy would be changed if it started interfering with the bank’s broader goal of maintaining strong employment and stable inflation. While not a change in policy, it wa a nod to market concern that the Fed had a key decision on “auto-pilot,” a Powell put it last month, even a it pledged to be dependent on economic data. “The market are pricing in downside risk ... and they are obviously well ahead of the data, particularly if you look at this morning’s labour market data,” Powell said. “I’ll just say that we are listening carefully to that ..., listening sensitively to the message that market are sending, and we are going to be taking those downside risk into account a we make policy going forward.”',\n",
       " 'From rising wage to a slowdown in housing, economic evidence is mounting that the U.S. Federal Reserve is at or near a neutral level of interest rate where it can take stock of where the economy stand before deciding on it next moves, Cleveland Federal Reserve president Loretta Mester said on Friday. The comment from a usually hawkish reserve bank president, made in an interview on the sideline of the American Economic Association annual meeting, add to the sense that the roughly quarterly pace of rate hike enacted by the Fed for the past two year may take a pause this year absent a surprise jump in inflation or faster-than-expected economic growth. “We are in a new world,” Mester said, where the obvious need to raise rate ha given way to a situation where economic growth is expected to slow, wage are rising on the basis of low unemployment, interest rate sensitive sector of the economy like housing have ebbed, and the unemployment rate ha roughly “stabilized” at a low level. Taken together, Mester said, those are the sort of development one would expect in an economy where interest rate were near a neutral level that wa neither encouraging nor holding back economic activity. “We really need to be looking at the data and having the economy tell us, do we need to move more? Do we need to move more, faster? Can we wait?” Mester said. “We should take our time and assess....We may be where we need to be.” Overall, she said she felt the Fed wa in a “really good spot.” Mester, reiterating comment by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell earlier in the day, said she wa also paying careful attention to recent volatility in financial markets, both for the information that may convey about economic risks, and for the risk volatility itself could produce if it start to undermine economic confidence. “Obviously that is something you want to pay attention to,” Mester said. But she said the turbulence may also stem from a different view of the economy than that shared by many Fed official who feel confident U.S. growth will remain on track for the next year, with labour market still strong. “What doe what is going on in the financial market tell you about the fundamentals? That is an open question,” Mester said. “My interpretation is that the market did see and put emphasis on the downside risk to growth and some of the softening data coming out of China and some of the European countries. On the other hand the economic fundamental and today’s labour market report support a view that the U.S. economy is still on sound footing.” Stocks surged on Friday after the Labor Department reported U.S. firm created 312,000 job in December, and Powell said the Fed would be flexible in deciding on any further rate increases.',\n",

Officials said the victim were villager who were mining for gold illegally, rather than in a government project. “Poor villager during winter try to compensate their earnings by pursuing illegal mining. They dig tunnel to enter the mines,” Nek Mohammad Nazari, a spokesman for the provincial governor, said. He said the tunnel had caved in. A police spokesman for Badakhshan province, Sanaullah Rohani, earlier said the cause of the accident, which occurred in heavy snowfall, wa a landslide. Rohani said seven people were injured alongside the at least 30 killed, while they were working inside the mine in Kohistan district. Rohani said about 50 illegal miner were present in the mine when the incident occurred and two rescue team were deployed to help the injured.

       " 'Dozens of Thai activist on Sunday protested against a possible delay of a national election set for next month, the first such gathering since the military government lifted a ban on political activity imposed after a 2014 coup. The junta ha promised and postponed the election several time since it came to power, with the latest date set for Feb. 24. However, the vote face yet another postponement after Deputy Prime Minister Wissanu Krea-ngam suggested on Friday that post-election event might clash with ritual related to King Maha Vajiralongkorn’s coronation from May 4-6. That prompted the first protest since the junta lifted a ban on political activity and a gathering of more than five people in December. “We want the government to hold an election a soon a possible, so that democracy can move forward in our country,” said Anon Nampa, a human right lawyer and anti-junta activist who organised the protest at the Victory Monument area in central Bangkok. Protestors carried sign which read “We Want Election” and “Election only on Feb 24, 2019”, chanting “No delay!” in unison. Thailand’s Election Commission ha not officially announced the postponement but said it ha acknowledged the government’s suggestion that the vote be pushed back. The military government also failed to issue an official decree committing to holding a general election by Friday, meaning it is le likely to be held on Feb. 24 under the current timeline laid out. The election is meant to restore democracy after a 2014 military coup ousted an elected prime minister, though change to the constitution in the interim ensure the military will retain a great deal of control.',\n",

China ha a vibrant lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender scene (LGBT) scene, though activist say conservative attitude among some group in society have prompted occasional government clampdowns. On Saturday, citing academic research, financial magazine Caixin said juvenile were heavily involved in the gay dating app, where some teenager had even hosted livestreaming. It added that many gay teenager had unprotected sex through the app and contracted HIV, the virus that cause AIDS. In response, Blued vowed to launch a “comprehensive content audit and regulation,” and crack down on juvenile user posing a adult and on texts, picture and group that involve minors. “Blued always forbids juvenile from logging on and using the app,” it said in a statement on it verified account on China’s Twitter-like Weibo. The company added that it had enabled artificial intelligence to weed out pornographic content since last year, and vowed to further support AIDS prevention work.

       " 'Apple Inc’s chief executive Tim Cook ha his work cut out in China this year: the iPhone maker face the looming threat of a court-ordered sale ban, the uncertain outcome of trade war talk and the roll-out of a new 5G network, where it find itself behind rival like Huawei and Samsung. The complex outlook raise a challenge for Apple a it look to revive it China fortune after weakness there sparked a rare drop in it global sale forecast, knocked $75 billion from it market valuation and roiled global markets. Cook told investor that the main drag on the firm’s performance in China had been a sharper-than-expected slowdown in the country’s economy, exacerbated by the impact of trade tension between Washington and Beijing. “We did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China,” he said. Chinese shopper told Reuters another element had been key: the high price-tag on Apple’s flagship phones. Analysts said the firm faced a brewing storm of challenges: an economic slowdown, stronger rival like Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] bringing out comparable tech at lower price and bubbling patriotic sentiment amid the trade war. A Chinese court ha also issued a preliminary injunction banning some Apple phones, part of a legal battle with chip maker Qualcomm Inc. This ban, potentially hitting iPhone model from the 6S through the X, ha yet to be enforced. On Thursday a local industry body, the China Anti-Infringement and Anti-Counterfeit Innovation Strategic Alliance, called on Apple to heed the court order and not “trample the Chinese law by leveraging it super economic power and clout.” Apple declined to comment on the group’s statement but ha previously said it belief it current phone comply with the Chinese court’s order. “These are tough time for Apple in China,” said Neil Shah, research director at Counterpoint, adding the iPhone could see it market share slip to 7 percent this year in the face of stronger local rival and worry about the sale ban. Apple’s market share in the third-quarter of 2018 wa around 9 percent, and ha dipped from above 14 percent in 2015, overtaken by local rival like Huawei, Oppo and Vivo. Apple v Huawei: tmsnrt.rs/2GWXNEf Another question mark for Apple is it 5G strategy in China, where the U.S. firm is not expected to have a 5G-enabled phone until 2020, behind rival like Huawei, Xiaomi Corp and Samsung Electronics. China is looking to push ahead with it rollout of a faster 5G network, with a pre-commercial phase this year and a commercial network in 2020. Some are looking to make an early bet on the technology. Huawei is planning a 5G phone mid-year, while Xiaomi is aiming for the third quarter. Samsung is expected to unveil a 5G phone in the first half of the year. Industry insiders, however, said Apple would likely hold off until the fall of 2020 to have it own 5G-enabled phone, a strategy that would bypass the untested early period of the technology, but which could mean Chinese shopper delay iPhone purchase or buy another brand that switched to 5G earlier. “I’ll definitely be paying attention to 5G functionality when I buy my next phone,” said Wu Chengjun, a graduate student in Beijing who currently us an iPhone X. With the exception of Huawei, which make it own 5G chips, Qualcomm is providing the technology to many of the major phone maker releasing 5G handset this year. “If you’re a [phone maker] looking for a ‘super cycle’ [of sales], if you don’t have 5G, your situation won’t get any better,” Cristiano Amon, Qualcomm’s president, told Reuters in an interview. “The carrier channel is going to be incentivized to start selling 5G phone in the second half” of 2019, he said. But there are risk integrating 5G too early into high-end smart phone because the technology requires deeply re-designing the device with multiple new antennas. Given spotty coverage in 2019, gambling on a new design before network are mature could be more risk than reward, said Darryn Lowe, a Bain & Co partner who work with the wireless industry. “When you think about 5G, it’s a heck of a lot more complicated than an aluminum strip running around the phone,” he said. And other shopper and analyst said Apple’s more cautious approach to 5G made sense and that the firm would not likely lose out too much to rival by delaying it launch. Apple’s decision to wait to adopt 4G until after other maker didn’t hurt it. But that wa when consumer commonly purchased a phone every two years, a cycle that ha elongated and might prompt buyer to want a more “future proof” device, said Glenn Lurie, CEO of Synchronoss Technologies and the former head of AT&T’s wireless unit. “If you’re going to walk in to make a 30-month decision, the concept that I’ve already got 5G built in, it feel pretty good,” Lurie said. But buyer such a Li Hongzhuo, 22, a student in Beijing, said he wa interested in 5G, but it wouldn’t be the deciding factor and he preferred to wait until the technology wa tried and tested. “Typically my need for my phone are high speed for downloading video or transferring file from chat apps. This will get faster (with 5G), but 4G already satisfies my needs,” said Li. “I won’t really consider switching my phone until 5G ha been operating stably on the market for some time without any bug – or unless they stop offering 4G.”',\n",

       " 'Senator Elizabeth Warren informally kicked off the 2020 Democratic presidential nominating fight on a weekend visit to Iowa, condemning the corrupting influence of money on politics and lamenting lost economic opportunity for working families. In the state that hold the first presidential nominating contest in 13 months, Warren introduced herself to Iowa crowd with tale of her working-class upbringing in Oklahoma and emphasized her signature theme of income inequality. “Washington work great for those with money but not for anyone else. We need to call this what it is, corruption pure and simple,” the Massachusetts senator told Democrats in Sioux City on the second of five public stop during her three-day visit. It wa an early jump on the race for Warren, who formed a presidential exploratory committee and began hiring staff this week. So far she is the biggest name to enter what promise to be a crowded Democratic field, with at least two dozen others considering a run. Former Housing Secretary Julian Castro also ha formed an exploratory committee, and former U.S. Representative John Delaney became the first Democrat to formally declare last year and ha campaigned extensively in the state. But Warren, 69, had Iowa to herself this weekend, and she used the time to make contact with prominent state activist and court crowd with promise to fight what she called a rigged economic system that favour the wealthy. “These are dangerous time for our country, and Iowa is going to play a big part in determining where we go next,” said Warren. She ha been one of the most outspoken critic of President Donald Trump, a Republican, but rarely mentioned him by name at her public event on Friday and Saturday. In the Senate, Warren is also an outspoken critic of Wall Street and is a leader of the party’s progressive wing, but she could face competition in the nomination fight from other liberal voice such a fellow Senators Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris. Democrats face lingering tension between their most liberal voice such a Warren and the more pragmatic wing, which includes former Vice President Joe Biden and several former governor and mayor who are considering running. In Iowa, Warren said her childhood in Oklahoma shaped her populist economic views. She wa the daughter of a janitor who lost work after a heart attack, forcing her mother to take a minimum wage job. “That minimum wage job saved our house and it saved our family,” Warren said. “Today, a minimum wage job in America will not keep a momma and a baby out of poverty. That’s why I’m in this fight.” Local Democrats said they were anxious to start focusing on picking a challenger for Trump, although most said it wa way too early for them to commit to a candidate. “This is just the beginning, I’m excited to see it start,” said Lisa Koch, 48, an attorney from Council Bluffs who said she wa a long-time fan of Warren’s but worried her gender, age or combative approach might turn off some voters. Linda Drury, 62, of Holstein, Iowa, said she wa impressed with Warren. She wa afraid Warren might come off a angry, but “that’s not anger, that’s passion.” A December Des Moines Register/CNN poll of likely 2020 Democratic caucus-goers in Iowa found Warren in fourth place with 8 percent support, trailing three candidate who have not yet entered the race - Biden at 32 percent, Sanders at 19 percent and former U.S. Representative Beto O’Rourke of Texas at 11 percent. That poll found 65 percent of likely caucus-goers viewed Warren favourably, and 20 percent saw her unfavourably. Angela Nelson, 50, a special education teacher from Omaha, Nebraska, said she wa concerned to see question raised about Warren’s likeability amid comparison to Hillary Clinton, the unsuccessful 2016 Democratic nominee. “It bother me that there is this test of likability just because she is a woman,” Nelson said. “It’s time for our country to move beyond that.” In Sioux City, Warren wa asked by a member of the crowd about her controversial decision to take a DNA test to ease question about her claim to Native American ancestry. Trump frequently belittles Warren’s claim by calling her “Pocahantas,” but she faced criticism from fellow Democrats and Native Americans for taking the test. “I am not a person of colour. I am not a citizen of a tribe. Tribal citizenship is very different from ancestry. Tribes, and only tribes, determine tribal citizenship, and I respect that difference,” Warren said. “My decision wa to put it all out there.”',\n",

Makarenko, born in 1979, ha arrived on Saipan Island with his wife, underage child and elderly parents. He wa detained by FBI personnel at the airport right after his arrival,” the ministry said.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said this week that Washington had asked Moscow to explain Whelan’s arrest and would demand his immediate return if it determined his detention is inappropriate. Britain cautioned Russia on Friday that individual should not be used a diplomatic pawns. Whelan also hold a British passport. The Russian ministry said in it statement that Moscow diplomat had not been able to reach Makarenko in Florida and said Washington had yet to explain his detention. Before Moscow gave detail of Makarenko’s detention, expert had speculated that Moscow could exchange Whelan for Russian national held by Washington. Commenting on that possibility, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said on Saturday: “I see no reason to raise this issue in context of exchanges. We should undergo all the procedure needed in this situation,” Interfax news agency quoted Ryabkov a saying. Whelan’s Toronto-based twin brother David Whelan told Reuters on Saturday that U.S. embassy official met with his sibling on Wednesday and would visit him again next week. “He seemed a well a can be expected in a Russian jail. He wa missing a lot of personal necessities, like toilet paper, that aren’t provided,” David Whelan said in a telephone interview. “So the State Department ha helped u set up an account ... so that he can buy the supply that he needs.”',\n",
       " 'Germany’s BSI cyber defence agency on Saturday defended it role in responding to a far-reaching data breach, saying it could not have connected individual case it wa aware of last year until the entire data release became public. The government said on Friday that personal data and document from hundred of German politician and public figure including Chancellor Angela Merkel had been published online, in what appeared to be one of Germany’s biggest data breaches. The incident ha shocked the establishment and prompted call for security agency to clarify whether any security deficiency they were aware of had been exploited, and if they could have acted sooner to head off the breach. The BSI said in a statement that it wa contacted by a lawmaker in early December about suspicious activity on their private email and social medium accounts. “Only by becoming aware of the release of the data set via the Twitter account ‘G0d’ on Jan. 3, 2019, could the BSI in a further analysis on Jan. 4, 2019 connect this case and four other case that the BSI became aware of during 2018,” it said. “At the beginning of December 2018, it wa not foreseeable that there would be more cases.” The BSI said on Friday all but one of the seven party in the lower house had been affected. German medium said that party wa the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD). Last year, lawmaker said a powerful cyber attack had breached the foreign ministry’s computer network. Security official have blamed most previous breach of data security on a Russian hacking group, while the Kremlin ha consistently denied involvement in such incidents. After the latest data breach, Justice Minister Katarina Barley said she wa considering stricter security requirement for software maker and Internet platform operators. “We are examining the extent to which stricter legal provision are useful and necessary here,” she told weekly newspaper Welt am Sonntag, according to a pre-released article. Authorities were investigating all possibilities, including espionage, one government source said on Friday, adding that it wa unlikely any single person could have compiled the massive amount of data that had been released. The BSI said investigation so far had showed the data breach predominantly concerned private and personal accounts, but that it is responsible for the operational protection of government networks.

       " 'Comments from Brazil’s new right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro that he would be open to the United States operating a military base on Brazilian soil have not been well received by the country’s armed forces, a senior army officer told Reuters on Saturday. Bolsonaro, who took office on Jan. 1, said in a television interview on Thursday he might be willing to allow a U.S. base in Brazil a a way to counter Russian influence in Venezuela, a move that would mark a sharp shift in direction for Brazilian foreign policy. Brazil’s military would be against a U.S. base in the country, the officer said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he ha not been authorized to discus the matter publicly. He added that the possibility of ceding territory for a base took officer by surprise in the Brazilian military, which ha traditionally been a zealous guardian of national sovereignty. The Ministry of Defense said on Saturday it ha not been informed of such a proposal by Bolsonaro, a former Army officer turned politician who ha appointed retired general to his cabinet. “The president ha not discussed this with the defence minister,” said Major Sylvia Martins, a spokeswoman for the ministry. Bolsonaro, an admirer of U.S. President Donald Trump, ha quickly moved to align Brazil more closely with the Trump administration, which wa represented by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo at his swearing in on Tuesday. Pompeo told reporter on Wednesday that the United States and Brazil had “an opportunity to work alongside each other against authoritarian regimes” in the region, naming Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua. Foreign Minister Ernesto Araújo confirmed Bolsonaro’s willingness to allow a U.S. base in comment to reporter in Lima on Friday during a meeting of the Lima Group of 13 country monitoring Venezuela’s political and economic crisis. Araújo said Bolsonaro would discus the base offer with Trump during an expected visit to Washington in March, the Estado de S. Paulo newspaper reported. The Lima Group of Latin American nation plus Canada said on Friday that last year’s election in Venezuela were not democratic and they would not recognise the legitimacy of leftist President Nicolas Maduro’s new term starting Jan. 10. Bolsonaro said in the television interview that he is worried about Russia’s closeness with Maduro, the most significant U.S. foe in Latin America. A visit to Venezuela by two Russian nuclear-capable strategic bomber in December angered the U.S. government..',\n",
       " 'Thousands marched through Budapest’s city centre on Saturday to protest against a new law that allows employer to ask staff to work up to 400 hour per year of overtime. Opposition group have staged several rally in the past week in the Hungarian capital and other city against what they said wa an authoritarian rule of conservative nationalist Viktor Orban. Saturday’s rally, organised by opposition parties, trade union and civic groups, mainly targeted the new labour law dubbed by critic a “slave law”. The protester marched in snowfall from the historic Heroes Square to the parliament building on the bank of the Danube river, carrying banner such a “Sweep away the regime”. “We disagree with almost everything that is going on since this government got into power (in 2010), from corruption to pseudo-democracy,” said 50-year old housewife Eva Demeter. She said more Hungarians were pouring onto the street because the slave law “affects a bigger crowd”. Some of the protester posted on social medium or carried banner calling for a “national strike”. The modification to the labour code passed by parliament last month ha faced intense criticism and sparked the biggest street protest in over a year. Potentially, it could add two extra hour to an average work day, or the equivalent of an extra workday per week. Zoltan Mucsi, the head of steelmaker Dunaferr’s Vasas trade union, said it wa undemocratic that the government did not discus the labour code change with the unions. Some of the main trade union group may resort to a strike if the government doe not sit down with them to negotiate, he told Reuters. Trade union membership in Hungary is estimated at below a tenth of the workforce, about half the level in Germany, according to data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The past weeks’ anti-government rally were also against a law that set up new court which critic say could be politically manipulated, and against bias in state-controlled media. The earlier protest have been mostly peaceful, though there were some clash with police who used tear gas. The ruling Fidesz party reiterated in a statement on Thursday that the protest were part of a campaign for the European Parliament election in May to help those who support mass migration into the European Union. Fidesz won Hungarian election with a landslide last year, with the ticket of resisting mass immigration into the EU.',\n",

       " 'After two week stranded at sea and battered by winter storms, migrant onboard a rescue ship are growing frustrated, supply are dwindling and the crew are exhausted a European country refuse to offer a safe port of call. The Sea-Watch 3, a vessel run by a German humanitarian group, plucked 32 people from an unsafe boat off the coast of Libya on Dec. 22, including three small child who are suffering from seasickness and four teenagers, who are travelling alone. The vessel is now in Maltese water sheltering from high wind and rough seas. In an act of desperation, one migrant jumped into the frigid water on Friday, trying to swim for shore, but wa quickly pulled back on board by the crew. “We are here on this boat and we do not understand what is happening,” Bob Kiangala, from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, told Reuters. “We are not fish, we are not sharks, we are human being like everyone else. We made this crossing, we risked our life to get to Europe, and now that we have arrived, Europe refuses, and we do not know why,” he said. Another German humanitarian group, Sea-Eye, is also in water off Malta with 17 people rescued on Dec. 29 on board it ship. This week almost two dozen humanitarian groups, including Amnesty International and the United Nations’ International Organisation for Migration, called on the European Union to offer a safe port to both vessels. Until June last year, Italy took in almost all of the migrant rescued by humanitarian groups, but since then the new populist coalition government’s Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, who lead the anti-immigrant League party, ha closed the port to rescue ships. In a surprising move, Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio, leader of the 5-Star Movement, said that Italy would take in the woman and child if Malta allowed the ship to dock. “Malta should allow the immediate disembarkation of woman and child and send them to Italy,” Di Maio wrote on Facebook on Friday. “Children shouldn’t pay the price of a Europe that turn it back so it cannot see.” However, underscoring tension within the government over migration, Salvini swiftly replied on his own Facebook page that Italy should not take in any more boat migrants. “Human trafficking must be stopped. People escaping war should come to Italy by plane, a many already do, not by boat. We can send medicines, food and clothes to the boats, but enough of this blackmail,” he wrote. “I have not changed my mind.” In recent month Spain and Malta have agreed to take in some rescued migrants, but often not before long negotiation with other EU countries. As a consequence, most humanitarian group have abandoned sea rescue efforts. Crew member on the Sea-Watch 3 are in good spirit but tired, getting an average of about five hour sleep a night, and the migrants, many of whom endured month of abuse in Libya after making a dangerous desert crossing, are showing sign of stress and mental fatigue, Sea-Watch’s head of mission, Philipp Hahn, said.

       " '3 MIN READ LONDON, Jan 4 - Lending to British consumer grew at it slowest pace in nearly four year in November and the number of mortgage approval fell, Bank of England data showed, adding to sign of a pre-Brexit slowdown in the economy. The annual growth rate in unsecured consumer lending slowed to 7.1 percent from 7.4 percent in October, the BoE figure showed, the slowest increase since March 2015. There have been sign from many retailer that British consumer reined in their spending in late 2018, faced with the possibility of the country leaving the European Union without a deal to smooth the economic shock. Prime Minister Theresa May face a make-or-break vote on her Brexit plan in the week of Jan. 14, little more than two month before Britain is due to end it membership of the EU. A survey of Britain’s dominant service industry published on Friday suggested the economy grew by just 0.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared with the previous three months, a uncertainty about Brexit mounted. The BoE said the number of mortgage approved for house purchase fell to 63,728 in November, the lowest figure since April and down from 66,709 in October. The figure wa below all forecast in a Reuters poll of economists. Britain’s housing market weakened in 2018 with major mortgage lender reporting price growth at a five-year low. Nationwide said earlier on Friday that price fell in December by the most in monthly term since mid-2012 and rose at their slowest annual pace in nearly six years. The BoE data showed net mortgage lending, which tends to lag behind approvals, at 3.453 billion pound in November, up from 4.089 billion pound in October. BoE Governor Mark Carney warned last month that in the event of a “disorderly” departure from the EU — which is not the central bank’s base-case scenario — house price could slump by 30 percent a part of a broader economic shock. The central bank ha also said demand for consumer lending had been subdued by Brexit uncertainty, but might ramp up again once the situation is clearer. Figures for November alone showed a 924 million-pound net increase in consumer lending, slightly weaker than economists’ forecasts. The BoE also said net gilt purchase by foreign investor totalled 2.387 billion pound in November compared with a revised lower 5.014 billion pound in October and 8.649 billion pound in November 2017.',\n",

May still hope to get her deal through parliament, though even member of her own cabinet admit privately that to do so she will need to make significant change and win over lot of opposition lawmakers. If the lower house of the British parliament doe not approve May’s deal then the world’s fifth-largest economy will leave the EU without one on March 29 at 2300 GMT a the date is set in law - the 2018 Withdrawal Act. The Northern Irish DUP, whose 10 lawmaker have propped up May’s minority government, ha demanded she ditch the Irish backstop, something the EU and May have ruled out. The DUP’s Wilson told BBC radio that the Irish backstop wa a “con trick” and added that farmer and business should be totally relaxed about a no-deal Brexit. “If anyone should be worried about the tariff on beef and sheep then it should be the Irish because of course, we, the United Kingdom are net importer of food,” Wilson said. Facing the defeat of her deal last month, May postponed a parliamentary vote on it, pledging to seek “legal and political assurances” from the EU. Those effort appear so far to be in vain. The EU said it will not reopen the negotiation though it signalled it might offer some concessions. May need 318 vote to get a deal through parliament yet 117 of her 317 lawmaker voted against her in a confidence vote on Dec. 12. So she will need the support of some of the Labour Party’s 257 lawmaker or to win over swathe of her own party and the DUP.',\n",

U.S. President Donald Trump said in December that U.S. troop had succeeded in their mission to defeat Islamic State militant and were no longer needed in the country. The announcement, which took official in Washington and ally abroad by surprise, contributed to Jim Mattis’ decision to resign a U.S. defence secretary and prompted concern that Islamic State could stage a comeback. “There is absolutely no change in the U.S. position against the use of chemical weapon by the Syrian regime and absolutely no change in our position that any use of chemical weapon would be met by a very strong response, a we’ve done twice before,” Bolton told reporter on his plane shortly before landing in Tel Aviv, Israel. “So the regime, the Assad regime, should be under no illusion on that question,” said Bolton, who is on a four-day trip to Israel and Turkey. Trump ha twice bombed Syria over the government’s alleged use of chemical weapons, in April 2017 and April 2018. In September a senior U.S. official said there wa evidence showing chemical weapon were being prepared by Syrian government force in Idlib, the last major rebel stronghold in the country. More than half a million people have died during the Syrian war and 11 million have been forced to flee their homes. During his trip Bolton is set to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan. He said he wa not suggesting Syria appeared ready to use chemical weapons. “As we elaborate how the (U.S. troop) withdrawal is going to occur and the circumstances, we don’t want the Assad regime to see what we do a representing any diminution in our opposition to the use of weapon of mass destruction,” he said. If chemical weapon were to be used, “a lot of option would be on the table ... if they don’t heed the lesson of those two strike the next one will be more telling,” Bolton said.',\n",
       " 'Rakhine insurgent killed 13 policeman and injured nine in attack on four police post in Myanmar’s Rakhine state on Friday a the country marked Independence Day, the official news agency said. Fighting resurged in Rakhine state in early December between government force and the rebel Arakan Army, which want greater autonomy for Rakhine, where the mainly Buddhist Rakhine ethnic group make up the majority. The Arakan Army doe not cite religion a a factor in it insurgency. It wa also in the restive western state that a military-led crackdown in 2017, following attack by Rohingya Muslim insurgents, prompted hundred of thousand of Rohingya to flee westward to neighbouring Bangladesh. The separate conflict between the military and Arakan Army rebel forced 2,500 civilian from their home by the end of last year, according to the United Nations. The Arakan Army say it ha been fighting for nearly a decade for self-determination in “the land of Arakan,” another name for Rakhine. An independent kingdom ruled in the coastal area until the 18th century. The Arakan Army is one of multiple armed group fighting in the name of ethnic minority in the rugged borderland of Myanmar, a country once known a Burma where around 90 percent of people are Buddhists. The official Myanmar News Agency said four police post in the Buthidaung area in northern Rakhine came under attack from hundred of Arakan Army fighter after daybreak on Friday. Thirteen policeman were killed and nine injured a police were forced to abandon two of the posts, it said, adding that the military wa now conducting a “clearance” of the area. Myanmar military spokesman Zaw Min Tun said the insurgent had hit police outpost near the border with Bangladesh. “These police post are there to protect the national race in the area so (Arakan Army rebels) shouldn’t attack them,” Zaw Min Tun said, referring to mostly Buddhist ethnic group in the area who are, unlike Rohingya Muslims, considered Myanmar citizens. Arakan Army spokesman Khine Thu Kha confirmed the assault and said rebel later retrieved the corps of seven “enemies”. He said later that rebel had freed at least 12 member of the security force it detained in the fighting. The attacks, he added, came in response to a Myanmar military offensive against the Arakan Army in recent week that had also targeted civilians. The military ha denied targeting civilians. The Myanmar military last month announced a four-month halt to fighting in the north and northeast of the country to kick-start peace talk with armed group seeking autonomy, but that announcement excluded Rakhine state. The Myanmar police force said on Saturday it had opened case against those involved in Friday’s attack under Myanmar’s Counter-Terrorism Law and a weapon law. “This is a carefully planned premeditated attack to harm the life and property of the people and to further aggravate the instability in the Rakhine State,” the English-language Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper said on Saturday. Friday’s violence erupted shortly after the national flag wa raised across the southeast Asian country to mark 71 year since independence from Britain, but the Arakan Army spokesman denied any connection between the attack and the anniversary. “We are not independent yet. Today is not our Independence Day,” Khine Thu Kha said. Last August, a U.N. report accused the Myanmar military of mass killing and rape of Rohingya with “genocidal intent” in 2017 in an operation that drove more than 700,000 of them to flee to Bangladesh, according to U.N. agencies.

       " 'A powerful Iranian council approved an anti-money laundering bill on Saturday, state medium reported, a major step towards reform that would bring Iran into line with global norm and could facilitate foreign trade in the face of U.S sanctions. Iran ha been trying to implement standard set by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an inter-governmental organisation that underpins the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing. Foreign business say Iran’s compliance with FATF standard and it removal from the organisation’s blacklist are essential if they are to increase investment, especially after reimposition of the U.S. sanction on Tehran. However, Iranian hardliner have opposed passing legislation toward compliance with the FATF, arguing it could hamper Iranian financial support for ally such a Lebanon’s Hezbollah, which the United States list a a terrorist organisation. Parliament last year passed the anti-money laundering bill, one of four amendment Iran need to implement to meet FATF requirements, but the Guardian Council, a vetting body, rejected it, saying it wa against Islam and the constitution. On Saturday, the Expediency Council, a body intended to resolve dispute between parliament and the Guardian Council, approved the bill with some changes, state news agency IRNA said, quoting a member of the council. The move came after Ayatollah Sadeq Amoli Larijani - the chief of hardline judiciary - wa appointed last week a the head of the Expediency Council. He is the brother of Ali Larijani, the speaker of the parliament. Seven month after his harsh dismissal of parliamentary effort to adapt FATF and other international convention on money laundering, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei seems to have warmed to the reforms, a reversal that expert say is aimed at preventing Iran’s economic collapse. In recent months, city have been rocked by demonstration a factory workers, teachers, truck driver and farmer protested against economic hardship. The sanction have depressed the value of Iran’s rial currency and aggravated annual inflation fourfold to nearly 40 percent in November. U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from a nuclear deal with Iran last year and reimposed the sanction on it banking and energy sectors, hoping to curb it missile and nuclear programme and counter it growing influence in the Middle East. European signatory of the nuclear deal are still committed to the accord and seek to launch a mechanism, a so-called special purpose vehicle (SPV), aiming to sidestep the U.S. financial system by using an EU intermediary to handle trade with Iran. The director general of Iran’s Strategic Council on Foreign Relations, an advisory body set up by Khamenei, voiced his support for the FATF-related bill on Friday. “It is better to finalise the FATF and CFT (counter financing of terrorism regimes) in the earliest time, so the Europeans have no excuse not to implement the (SPV) mechanism,” Abdolreza Faraji wa quoted by semi-official ISNA new agency.',\n",

       " 'China’s population is set to reach a peak of 1.442 billion in 2029 and start a long period of “unstoppable” decline in 2030, government scholar said in a research report published on Friday. The world’s most populous country must now draw up policy to try to cope with a declining labour force and a rapidly ageing population, according to the summary of the latest edition of the “Green Book of Population and Labor” published by the China Academy of Social Sciences (CASS). Growth in the working population had now stagnated, the report said, and the rising number of elderly people will have a far-reaching impact on the social and economic development in the country, especially if fertility rate remain low. “From a theoretical point of view, the long-term population decline, especially when it is accompanied by a continuously ageing population, is bound to cause very unfavourable social and economic consequences,” it said. China’s population is expected to fall back to 1.36 billion by the middle of the century, it said, which could mean a decline in the workforce of a much a 200 million. If fertility rate remain unchanged, the population could fall to 1.17 billion by 2065, it said. China decided in 2016 to relax a controversial “one-child policy” aimed at curbing population growth and allow all couple to have two children. However, the country’s birth rate still fell 3.5 percent in 2017 and is expected to have fallen again last year. China’s “dependency rate” - or the proportion of non-working people, including child and the elderly, in the total population - rose for the first time in more than 30 year in 2011, and is widely predicted to increase further for at least the next few decades. The proportion of retiree is projected to rise until 2060, the CASS report said, and while the decision to relax “one-child” rule wa designed to rebalance China’s age structure, in the short term it will also lead to a greater dependency rate. According to previous forecasts, China’s elderly population is expected to reach 400 million by the end of 2035, up from around 240 million last year.',\n",

The Chang’e-4 lunar probe, launched in December, made the “soft landing” at 0226 GMT and transmitted the first-ever “close range” image of the far side of the moon, the China National Space Administration said. The moon is tidally locked to Earth, rotating at the same rate a it orbit our planet, so most of the far side - or “dark side” - is never visible to us. Previous spacecraft have seen the far side, but none ha landed on it. The landing “lifted the mysterious veil” of the far side of the moon and “opened a new chapter in human lunar exploration”, the agency said in a statement on it website, which included a wide-angle color picture of a crater from the moon’s surface. The probe, which ha a lander and a rover, touched down at a targeted area near the moon’s south pole in the Von Karman Crater after entering the moon’s orbit in mid-December. The task of the Chang’e-4 include astronomical observation, surveying the moon’s terrain, landform and mineral makeup, and measuring the neutron radiation and neutral atom to study the environment of it far side. The control center in Beijing will decide when to let the rover separate from the lander, state news agency Xinhua said. “It’s an important milestone for China’s space exploration,” Wu Weiren, chief designer of the lunar exploration program, said, according to Xinhua. The probe also took six live specie - cotton, rapeseed, potato, arabidopsis, fruit fly and yeast - to the lifeless environment to form a mini biosphere, Xinhua said.

But the private space race is also heating up, a numerous company aim to commercialize space travel, such a California-based SpaceX, which ha upended the industry with it low-cost reusable Falcon 9 rockets. The United States is the only country to have landed human on the moon, and Trump said in 2017 he wanted to return astronaut to the lunar surface to build a foundation for an eventual Mars mission. NASA administrator have said people could be put on Mars by a soon a the mid-2030s, with the agency having landed eight spacecraft there, the most recent in November. As soon a 2022, NASA expects to begin building a new space station laboratory to orbit the moon, a a pit stop for mission to distant part of the solar system. In 2003, China became the third country to put a man in space with it own rocket after the former Soviet Union and the United States, and in 2017 it said it wa preparing to send a person to the moon. China completed it first lunar “soft landing” in 2013, but it “Jade Rabbit” rover began malfunctioning after several weeks.',\n",
       " 'A former North Korean diplomat who staged a high-profile defection to the South on Saturday urged an old colleague who ha gone missing in Italy to defect to Seoul, following a report that he wa seeking asylum in the United States. Jo Song Gil, the 44-year-old who wa until recently North Korea’s acting ambassador to Italy, disappeared with his wife after leaving the embassy without notice in early November, South Korean lawmaker said on Thursday. Jo ha sought asylum in the United States and is under the protection of Italian intelligence, Italy’s La Repubblica newspaper said on Friday, citing an unidentified diplomatic source. The State Department and the U.S. embassy in Seoul did not immediately respond to a query from Reuters. In an open letter, Thae Yong Ho, Pyongyang’s former deputy ambassador to Britain, who said he went to the same university and worked with Jo before defecting to South Korea in 2016, urged Jo to follow in his footsteps. To defect to the South is an “obligation, not a choice” for North Korean diplomat committed to unification, Thae said, calling Seoul “the outpost” for that task. “If you come to South Korea, the day when our suffering colleague and North Korean citizen are liberated from the fetter would be moved forward,” Thae said in the letter released on his website. “If you come to Seoul, even more of our colleague would follow suit, and the unification would be accomplished by itself.” Thae said his family visited Jo in Rome in 2008, where the latter wa studying from 2006 to 2009. He guided them to site such a St. Peter’s Basilica in Vatican City. South Korea could not be “heaven on earth” but a place where Jo can realise his wishes, Thae said, highlighting the ardent desire for unification among many of the roughly 32,000 defector there. “The defector may not be a wealthy a South Koreans,” Thae added. “But isn’t it the only thing you and I, a North Korean diplomats, should do the rest of our life - to bring about unification and hand over a unified nation to our children?” If confirmed to have fled, Jo would be another Europe-based diplomat who ha sought to leave the impoverished, oppressive North under the rule of Kim Jong Un. In 2015, a counsellor in charge of science affair at the North’s embassy in Germany defected with his wife to an unidentified country, while a secretary-level trade official stationed in Bulgaria and his wife also fled, Thae told South Korean cable news Channel A in an interview this week. South Korean official said they could not comment on intelligence matters. Europe could be a safer place for North Korean diplomat than elsewhere due to it openness to receiving asylum seekers, defector and expert say. North Korea ha formal diplomatic tie with 26 European nations, a well a Britain and Germany, since 2013, Seoul’s Unification Ministry says. Pyongyang requires diplomat going overseas to leave at least one child at home, but those from the top echelon or seen a the most loyal to the regime get some exceptions. Jo hailed from a wealthy family of diplomats, and wa able to take his child on his posting to Italy in 2015, Thae said. “Diplomats in Europe are well-connected and sensitive to political change at home, which allow them to make a move quickly,” said Ahn Chan-il, a former North Korean military officer and defector. Ramon Pacheco Pardo, a North Korea specialist at Vrije Universiteit Brussel, said Europe offered a “more open, safer environment” for North Korean official to discus sensitive issue and consider defection. “Also, Western European countries, such a Italy or the United Kingdom, are very likely to approve the asylum application or support the defection of any North Korean official who asks for it,” said Pacheco Pardo, who regularly meet North Korean official and defector in Europe.',\n",
       " 'A second referendum on Britain’s membership of the European Union would only exacerbate division among the British people, Brexit minister Stephen Barclay told a German newspaper. Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd said last month there would be a “plausible argument” for another referendum if parliament failed to reach a consensus on the way forward, something Prime Minister Theresa May ha repeatedly ruled out. Barclay echoed May’s view. “A second referendum would cause yet more division,” he told German daily Die Welt. “The current extent to which Britain is divided now would be small compared to the tension that a second vote would cause. It would further divide our nation.” The future of a Brexit agreement that May negotiated with the EU hang in the balance in the run-up to a parliamentary vote, and call for a second referendum - which she ha consistently rejected - are growing. Brexit is scheduled for March 29. Barclay said a second referendum could not be organised before election to the European Parliament in May. “But then, European election would have to take place in Britain,” he added. “Which mean huge democratic damage, because people voted for a withdrawal but would have to nonetheless vote again at the end of May.” “Our European colleague couldn’t have any interest in it (a second referendum) either a that would trigger a very populist reaction,” he said. British lawmaker must choose whether to accept May’s plan for a structured exit and relatively close economic tie to the EU, or reject it and spawn huge uncertainty about the country’s next steps.

       " 'Bristol-Myers Squibb Co’s (BMY.N) announcement that it would buy Celgene Corp (CELG.O) for $74 billion (59 billion pounds) ha raised investors’ hope that a wave of consolidation among drugmakers could be coming. The following are some of the company in the sector whose share rose on Thursday on takeover speculation following the deal announcement: INCYTE CORP (INCY.O), ENDED TRADING UP 7 PERCENT The failure of an Incyte immunotherapy drug in combination with Merck & Co’s (MRK.N) Keytruda in a melanoma trial last year sent it share reeling. But analyst have said it bone marrow disorder treatment, Jakafi, ha become a meaningful new revenue opportunity for the company. At a $15 billion market capitalisation, Incyte remains a digestible size for larger player such a Gilead Sciences Inc and Sanofi SA (SASY.PA). RBC analyst Brian Abrahams said in a research note on Thursday that Incyte is an acquisition target because it is undervalued and ha an oncology and inflammation pipeline. GILEAD SCIENCES INC (GILD.O), ENDED TRADING UP 3 PERCENT Gilead ha a hefty $85 billion market capitalisation, making it only a target for the largest global drugmakers. Its product portfolio target HIV/AIDS, hepatitis C, cancer, inflammatory and respiratory diseases, and cardiovascular conditions. The company recently named a new CEO, Daniel O’Day, who previously headed Roche Holdings AG’s (ROG.S) pharmaceutical business. O’Day is expected to help Gilead build out it global presence, especially in liver disease beyond hepatitis C, oncology and inflammation. ALEXION PHARMACEUTICALS INC (ALXN.O), ENDED TRADING UP 2 PERCENT Rare disease specialist Alexion, which ha faced pressure from activist hedge fund Elliott Management could be an acquisition target for company such a Amgen Inc (AMGN.O) or Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), analyst have said. Extremely expensive drug for ultra rare disease have become increasingly attractive to larger drugmakers. Raymond James analyst said in a research note that M&A could happen this year involving company focused on the huge unmet need for treating the progressive fatty liver disease known a NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis), which doe not yet have any approved treatments. Even though their share did not get a boost on Thursday, Madrigal Pharmaceuticals (MDGL.O) and Intercept Pharmaceuticals (ICPT.O) are among the leader developing treatment to tap a market that could eventually be worth $30 billion. As they race towards regulatory approval for NASH, these company could become target for larger biotechs. Allergan, for example, bought Tobira in 2016 for it experimental NASH drug for $1.8 billion, 19 time what the stock market wa valuing the company. RBC’s investor survey showed Intercept, which wa a market value of $2.8 billion, wa a favoured takeout candidate by investor for this year. Several other small company are also developing promising NASH drugs.',\n",
       " 'Ireland posted it first underlying budget surplus for a decade in 2018, a year ahead of government forecasts, a high windfall tax and low interest payment ended a decade of deficits, Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said on Thursday. Ireland’s deficit ballooned into double figure in 2009 when property price collapsed, sparking a banking crisis and a three-year international bailout. But the Irish economy posted the fastest growth in the European Union every year since 2014 and the country’s corporate tax take more than doubled since 2012. The exchequer recorded a budget surplus of 106 million euro (£95.6 million) in 2018, and the government expects to run another in 2019, the finance ministry said. The Irish exchequer posted a technical surplus of 1.9 billion euro in 2017 but once a 3.4 billion euro windfall from the sale of share in Allied Irish Banks wa excluded, it showed an underlying deficit. The exchequer wa 1.6 billion euro better off in 2018 than 2017, the finance ministry said. “This is the first time in 10 year that we have recorded a budget surplus,” Varadkar said. “It mean that we are very well prepared for a downturn or for an economic shock if that were to affect us.” “We would expect to do the same in 2019 but it absolutely something we can’t take for granted or be complacent about,” he added. Total budget expenditure in 2018 wa about 250 million euro le than forecast, largely due to lower than planned interest payment on the country’s national debt, Varadkar said. Meanwhile corporate tax receipts, much of which come from a small number of U.S. multinationals who book profit in Ireland, were 1.9 billion euro higher than expected, the finance ministry said. Varadkar said, however, that Ireland wa “not taking for granted” that corporate tax receipt would continue to exceed expectations. “We are actually projecting a fall off in tax take from corporations. So if they pay the same amount in 2019 a they did in 2018 it will be a pleasant surprise,” he said.',\n",

One fire in eastern Victoria, the second most populous state, prompted fire authority to issue a watch and act warning for resident in 14 different towns. The fire near Rosedale, about 200 km (124 miles) east of Melbourne, had burnt more than 10,000 hectare (25,000 acres) and sudden wind change on Friday created risky condition for roughly 40 firefighters, an emergency official said. “They found themselves in a very serious situation and they were shaken,” Andrew Crisp, the state’s emergency management commissioner, told reporter on Saturday. The origin of the Rosedale fire and another in Victoria were being treated a suspicious, with police and fire authority investigating their cause, he added. In the southern island state of Tasmania, a bushfire had burnt through 15,000 hectare (37,000 acres) of southwestern wilderness by Saturday, fire official said. Both Victoria and Tasmania had sweltered through above average temperature on Friday, with Melbourne recording a near-record 42 degree Celsius (107.6 F) and Hobart reaching 40 C (104 F).. But both state will see far cooler temperature over the weekend, following a rapid cool change on Friday, weather official said. “At 4.00 p.m., (Melbourne) wa at 42 degrees, by 4.20 p.m. it wa down to 26 degrees, and then continued to drop after that,” Keris Arndt, a meteorologist with the weather bureau, told Reuters. Yet by Saturday morning the cooling temperature had not reached part of Sydney, Australia’s most populous city, where the mercury reached almost 38 C (100.4 F) by midday.

       " 'China’s armed force must strengthen their sense of urgency and do everything they can to prepare for battle, President Xi Jinping told a meeting of top brass on Friday. China is keen to beef up it armed force amid territorial dispute in the South China Sea and escalating tension with the United States over issue ranging from trade to the status of Taiwan. The official Xinhua news agency said Xi told a meeting of the top military authority that China faced increasing risk and challenges, and the armed force must work to secure it security and development needs. Xi, who is also chairman of the Central Military Commission, said the armed force must devise strategy for the new era and take on responsibility for preparing and waging war. “The world is facing a period of major change never seen in a century, and China is still in an important period of strategic opportunity for development,” he wa quoted a saying. He said the armed force needed to be able to respond quickly to emergencies, needed to upgrade their joint operation capability and nurture new type of combat forces. Xi’s comment followed his remark on Wednesday that China still reserved the right to use force to achieve “reunification” with Taiwan and prevent the island’s independence. Xi’s Taiwan speech came just day after U.S. President Donald Trump signed the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act into law, reaffirming the U.S. commitment to the island’s security.',\n",
       " 'President Donald Trump threatened to keep the U.S. government partially shut for month or year on Friday after he and Democratic leader failed to resolve their dispute over Trump’s request for $5.6 billion (4.4 billion pounds) to build a wall on the Mexican border. After Democratic congressional leader refused Trump’s request at a meeting in the White House Situation Room, the Republican president threatened to take the controversial step of declaring a national emergency and building the wall without congressional approval. Trump is withholding his support for a bill that would fully fund the government until he secures money for the wall. As a result, around 800,000 public worker have been unpaid, with about a quarter of the federal government closed for two weeks. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats had told Trump during the meeting to end the shutdown. “He resisted,” Schumer said. “In fact, he said he’d keep the government closed for a very long period of time, month or even years.” Trump confirmed that comment but painted a more positive picture of the meeting, the first since a new era of divided government began when Democrats took control of the House of Representatives on Thursday. “We had a very, very productive meeting, and we’ve come a long way,” Trump said. According to a source familiar with the White House discussion, Trump opened the meeting with a speech that lasted at least 15 minute in which he insisted on the need for billion of dollar to fund a border wall. The source also said Trump brought up recent impeachment threat during those remarks, arguing that he had notched a strong performance a president and should not be a target for impeachment. The president later told reporter that Nancy Pelosi, the new Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives, said Democrats were not looking to impeach him. Raising the stake in his tussle with the newly emboldened Democrats, Trump threatened extraordinary measure to build the wall, which he say is needed to stem the flow of illegal immigrant and drug into the United States. A reporter asked Trump whether he had considered declaring a national emergency to build the wall. “Yes, I have. And I can do it if I want,” Trump said. “We can call a national emergency because of the security of our country ... I may do it. But we can call a national emergency and build it very quickly. And it’s another way of doing it. But if we can do it through a negotiated process, we’re giving that a shot.” Emergency power have been invoked by previous U.S. president during time of war. Senator Jack Reed, the senior Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, criticized the comments, saying in a statement, “Declaring a trumped up national emergency in order to skirt congressional approval is wrong.” The U.S. Constitution assigns Congress the power to fund the federal government, so Trump likely would face legal challenge if he tried to bypass Congress on financing the wall. Building a wall - and having Mexico pay for it - wa one of Trump’s main promise when he ran for president in 2016. Trump’s wall project is estimated to cost about $23 billion. Democrats have called the wall immoral, ineffective and medieval. Pelosi said Friday’s meeting with Trump wa “sometimes contentious” but that they agreed to continue talking. “But we recognise on the Democratic side that we really cannot resolve this until we open up government and we made that very clear to the president,” she said. Credit rating agency Moody’s said the shutdown will cause minimal U.S. economic and credit market disruption but there could be a more severe impact on financial market and the broad economy if the closure is protracted. A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll last week showed that 50 percent of the public blame Trump for the shutdown and 7 percent blame Republican lawmakers, while 32 percent blame Democrats. In a Dec. 11 meeting with Pelosi and Schumer, Trump said he would be “proud” to shut the government over the security issue and would not blame Democrats. He ha since said they are responsible. White House official and congressional staffer will meet at 11 a.m. EST (1600 GMT) on Saturday to try to end the impasse, White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said. House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy told reporter that Trump had named Vice President Mike Pence, senior aide Jared Kushner and Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen to work over the weekend. The partial shutdown is straining the country’s immigration system, worsening backlog in court and complicating hiring for employers. Federal agency such a the Justice Department, Commerce Department and department of Agriculture, Labour, Interior and Treasury have been hit by the shutdown. House Ways and Means Committee chairman Richard Neal, a Democrat, asked the Internal Revenue Service in a letter on Friday to explain the possible effect of the shutdown on the upcoming tax filing season for million of Americans.',\n",
       " 'Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Friday he owns no real estate, vehicle or personal property, echoing what expert say is a pattern among the country’s politician of shifting asset to relatives. Lopez Obrador, who took office in December, told a regular news conference his family’s car and home are in his wife’s name. The veteran leftist won a landslide victory in July after a campaign centered on rooting out corruption in Mexico, which expert say is among the worst in Latin America. Heg cut an austere figure, ditching the presidential residence, flying coach and driving a white Volkswagen Jetta. Transparency advocate welcome Lopez Obrador’s disclosure after battling to get member of his predecessor Enrique Pena Nieto’s administration to open up about their finances, said Alexandra Zapata of the Mexican Institution for Competitiveness (IMCO), a think-tank that promotes good governance and fighting corruption. But his declaration raised a many question about his wealth a it answered, she added. “The president, in an effort to send this message of austerity, loses credibility in how he talk about his property, his asset and his interests,” said Zapata, who is the group’s director of education and civic innovation. Lopez Obrador disclosed monthly net income of 108,744 peso (4,399.77 pounds) from his government work and saving worth 446,068 pesos. In addition to real estate and vehicles, Lopez Obrador’s personal possession and household goods, including work of art and other valuable objects, were disclosed in his wife’s name, a spokesman for the president’s office said. Mexican politician have long been accused of obscuring their wealth by registering asset under relatives’ names. Those who absorb the asset are sometimes referred to a “prestanombres,” or people who lend their names. Lopez Obrador ha slashed salary for public officials, including his own, and stressed on Friday that others in his administration would be required to declare their assets, too. The president said during the news conference that his principal asset had been a property in the southern state of Chiapas, which he inherited from his parent and is now registered under his children’s names. “Money ha never interested me,” he said. “I fight for ideals, for principles.” Under a new national anti-corruption system, federal, state and local official will soon be required to submit detailed disclosure about their income and assets, a well a those of their families. Lopez Obrador ha long cast himself a a man of the people in a poor country. During the news conference, he said he ha no credit card, a common refrain in his speeches. Just 37 percent of Mexicans had an account with a bank or other type of financial institution in 2017, according to a World Bank study of people over 15 year old. Former Mexican President Vicente Fox, who backed another candidate in the election, criticized the disclosure. “Only his grandmother could believe this,” Fox wrote in a post on Twitter. “Wake up, Mexico!!!”',\n",
       " 'Washington state will create a streamlined system to pardon people convicted of misdemeanour marijuana possession before the drug wa legal, under an initiative launched on Friday by Governor Jay Inslee, who is considering a run for U.S. president. Voters in Washington state and Colorado in 2012 made their two state the first in the United States to legalize marijuana for recreational use. Since then, eight other state have followed suit, while more than 30 state allow the use of medical marijuana. Federal law still ban cannabis. “We shouldn’t be punishing people for something that is no longer illegal in Washington state,” Inslee, a Democrat, said in a written statement. Under the governor’s so-called Marijuana Justice Initiative, anyone with a single misdemeanour marijuana conviction in Washington state between 1998 and 2012 could apply for a pardon. An estimated 3,500 people are eligible, according to Inslee’s office. Some people with past conviction have faced obstacle in applying for job and housing. Racial disparity in the prosecution of marijuana offence have hurt African Americans and other minorities, and civil right group have pushed politician to take up the issue. “This (action by Inslee) is a necessary first step for repairing the racially disparate harm of marijuana prohibition,” Jolene Forman, a senior staff attorney with the Drug Policy Alliance, which ha long pushed for pot legalization, said in a statement. Since 2014, at least 10 state have passed law to expunge certain marijuana convictions, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. A measure in the Washington state legislature that would have erased certain misdemeanour marijuana conviction failed to pas last year. In the absence of that legislation, Inslee exercised his executive authority to create a pardon system, said his spokeswoman Jaime Smith. It applies only to people with a single conviction because official did not want to be overwhelmed with applications, she said. Brad Klippert, a Republican member of the state House of Representatives, said he would have preferred the governor pardon only the most “extreme cases.” “I personally think it’s a horrible idea because marijuana is a very dangerous drug and that’s why it’s still illegal according to the federal government,” he said. Washington state law, before legalization, had classified possession of le than 40 gram of marijuana a a misdemeanour, with larger amount treated a a felony.',\n",
       " 'The new Democratic majority in the U.S. House of Representatives is quietly planning behind the scene for a series of investigation of Republican President Donald Trump, but no immediate flurry of subpoena materialized a some Democrats had hoped. Democratic leader began their new era of control with caution, reflecting their persistent concern that acting too quickly to press investigation of Trump’s tie with Russia or his personal tax record may be perceived a overreach and cause a backlash in the next election cycle. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi rolled out legislative proposal on Friday, including one to require presidential candidate to disclose publicly 10 year worth of tax returns, a direct response to Trump’s refusal to release his. Such caution contrasted with urgent demand from newer member of the House Democratic caucus, which took majority control on Thursday, for tough, swift action. Representative Rashida Tlaib wa filmed late on Thursday at a reception saying that Democrats were going to try to remove Trump from office, telling the crowd, “We’re going to impeach that motherfucker.” Her remark drew rebuke from Republicans and Democrats. House Republican Whip Steve Scalise said: “Pelosi’s got her first test and it happened on day one. How is she going to stand up to the most radical left element of her party when they become unhinged?” During a White House news conference, Trump said Tlaib’s comment wa a “dishonor to herself and to her family.” Trump had earlier tweeted that Democrats were discussing impeachment because they feared running against him in the 2020 election, when he will seek a second four-year term. “Everybody ha got their own style, it ain’t mine,” House Majority Whip James Clyburn told reporters, referring to Tlaib. “I don’t believe we ought to be talking about impeachment until we get this country back on track.” Tlaib defended her comment in an interview with a Detroit television station on Friday. “It’s probably exactly how my grandmother, if she wa alive, would say it,” she told NBC-affiliate WDIV. “I stand by impeaching the president of the United States,” Tlaib said. “I ran on that.” Whether or not impeachment proceeding follow, Democrats have been firm that they will closely scrutinize Trump, his business interest and the first two year of his presidency. Trump’s time in the White House so far ha been clouded by a U.S. special counsel’s inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election and possible coordination between Moscow official and the Trump campaign. Democrats also charge that several of Trump’s top aide and cabinet official have violated legal and ethical standard - a subject they believe is ripe for investigation. “President Trump set the tone from the top of his administration that behaving ethically and complying the law is optional, lady and gentleman, I stopped by here to say we’re better than that. It will not be optional,” Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings told a room of cheering staffers, offering a hint of what could be to come. Adam Schiff, the new chairman of the House Intelligence Committee circulated a memo in early 2018 that is now seen a a blueprint for the Democrats’ investigative agenda. Schiff maintains that committee Republicans prematurely abandoned their inquiry into Russian interference. Moscow denies meddling in the election and Trump denies collusion. For instance, committee Republicans “refused” to interview White House official Stephen Miller and Kellyanne Conway, former Trump White House aide Reince Priebus and Sean Spicer and private Trump advisor Allen Weisselberg and Alan Garten, the Schiff memo said, providing a list of possible witness that could be called by Democrats. Documents about Trump deal and finance from Deutsche Bank, should be obtained “via subpoena if necessary,” the memo said.',\n",
       " 'Mexico’s new leftist government on Friday called on it peer to refrain from interfering in Venezuela’s internal affairs, declining to back a regional declaration that urged Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro not to take office on Jan. 10. Mexico wa the sole country in the 14-member Lima Group that opted not to sign a statement critical of Maduro, the first time Mexico ha not supported a declaration by the group since it wa created in 2017 to push for democratic reform in Venezuela. Mexico wa once among the most outspoken critic of Maduro. But tie with Venezuela have warmed under President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who invited Maduro to his inauguration last month. Maximiliano Reyes, Mexico’s deputy foreign minister responsible for Latin America, said following a Lima Group meeting in Peru that Mexico wa concerned about the “situation regarding human rights” in Venezuela but would not comment on the legitimacy of it government. Instead, he asked the Lima Group to rethink it approach. “We call for reflection in the Lima Group about the consequence for Venezuelans of measure that seek to interfere in internal affairs,” Reyes said in a statement. In a Friday evening state television broadcast, Venezuela’s Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza said Maduro would take office on Jan. 10 in a “legitimate and constitutional” process, which he said “does not require the approval of any foreign government.” He said Venezuela wa “perplexed” by the statement and that the country would take reciprocal action for diplomatic step taken by any other government. Reyes called for mediation and dialogue from the Lima Group, not isolation. Mexico’s stance wa a blow to regional effort to ramp up pressure on Maduro ahead of his inauguration, which Venezuela’s opposition hoped would be a watershed moment to highlight how he ha undermined democracy and mismanaged the OPEC member’s economy. Still, Mexico did not appear to be lining up any heavyweight representation for the inauguration. Asked who would attend from Mexico, a foreign ministry spokesman said it would be the Mexican embassy’s charge d’affairs. Diplomatic measure against Venezuela from neighbouring country remain timid, and Friday’s communique added little to previous statement that urged Maduro to step down but offered few concrete mechanism to make this happen. Peru said last month that it would propose ending diplomatic relation with Venezuela to Lima Group members. But no country ha yet announced it would sever ties. The 13 remaining country in the Lima Group that signed Friday’s statement, which include Canada, Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Colombia, called Maduro’s new term “illegitimate” and urged him to hand power over to the National Assembly until democratic election can be held. They also said they would seek to bar high-ranking Venezuelan official from entering their territory or having access to their financial systems.',\n",

The arrival of several thousand migrant in recent months, many fleeing poverty and violence in Honduras, ha challenged Mexico’s new president to make good on pledge to protect migrant in Mexico, just a the United States make it increasingly hard for them to cross the border. Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who began his presidency last month, ha yet to detail how he will improve what he ha described a deplorable condition for people trekking thousand of mile across Mexico to the U.S. border. Officials in mid-December said that, of the nearly 6,000 migrant who had arrived in Tijuana in recent caravans, about half were at a large shelter in a former concert venue and another several hundred had dispersed to other shelter in the city, such a the one being closed. About 1,000 had crossed into the United States, while another 1,000 returned to their home countries. Tijuana official cited sanitary reason for closing the shelter, a two-story warehouse in a zone known for crime and prostitution near the border. The industrial site wa overcrowded, poorly lit and lacked proper facility for food preparation, said Isain Venegas, a supervisor in Mexico’s public health system. Common illness had been treated, he added. Officials told migrant that they could move to the bigger shelter, run by the federal government, about 7 mile (11 km) from the border. Many migrant protested, saying they did not expect other site to be any better. “Not one of the shelter in Tijuana ha the condition for them to keep u in ... the authority are tricking us,” said Honduran migrant Reinerio Laine. By mid-afternoon, several dozen migrant had refused to leave and were joined by U.S. activists, a federal and local police in riot gear took formation at the entrance. Others packed belonging and set off on foot to nearby shelters, while several dozen waited for a bus that would bring them to the larger, government-run facility. “We had hoped that now with President Lopez Obrador he could see the condition we’re in. They said he wa going to help, but they’ve treated u worse than animals,” said Maria Claros, 28, from Honduras. “We don’t have anywhere to wash or do our business. I bathe with cold water when I have 20 peso to pay for it,” she added. For decades, Tijuana, a notoriously crime-ridden border city, ha attracted migrant headed north. When Central Americans began arriving in large number in November, official provided lodging at a sport centre, but closed it after rain flooded the venue.

       " 'Democratic Republic of Congo’s electoral commission accused the country’s Catholic Church on Friday of “preparing an insurrection” by saying it know the winner of last Sunday’s presidential election. The commission is scheduled to release provisional result on Sunday but ha said there could be delay because of the slow arrival of tally sheets. Donatien Nshole, the secretary-general of the Church’s bishops’ conference, known a CENCO, said on Thursday it vote tally showed a clear victor in the Dec. 30 election, a pronouncement widely seen a a warning to authority against rigging the vote. “The announcement of voting trend by Priest Nshole is likely to brainwash the population while preparing an insurrection that CENCO alone will be responsible for,” commission president Corneille Nangaa wrote in a letter to CENCO president Marcel Utembi, seen by Reuters. Nangaa said CENCO’s declaration violated electoral law and a code of conduct signed by poll monitor that give the electoral commission, CENI, alone the authority to announce results. The Catholic Church is one of Congo’s most powerful institutions, representing about 40 percent of it 80 million people. The ruling coalition of President Joseph Kabila, which is backing his hand-picked successor Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, also took aim at CENCO on Thursday. The coalition “deplores ... the partisan, irresponsible and anarchic attitude of CENCO,” said Barnabe Kikaya Bin Karubi, an adviser to Kabila and spokesman for Shadary. The U.N. Security Council wa briefed behind closed door on the latest development on Friday at the request of France. French U.N. Ambassador Francois Delattre said the 15-member body would continue to monitor the electoral process in Congo. “The consolidation of the result must continue with transparency,” Delattre told reporters. “We call on all actor for calm and restraint.” Observers and the opposition say the election wa marred by serious irregularities. The opposition, represented by it two main candidate Martin Fayulu and Felix Tshisekedi, and Shadary’s camp have all claimed they are on course to win, without posting specific figures. Kikaya told Reuters Kabila had met Catholic bishop on Friday but provided no details. The government say the election wa fair and went smoothly. The poll is meant to lead to Congo’s first democratic transfer of power, but the international community ha raised concern that a disputed result could cause unrest, a wa the case after the 2006 and 2011 elections. President Donald Trump said on Friday about 80 U.S. military personnel had deployed to Gabon in case they were needed to protect American citizen and diplomatic facility in Congo. On Thursday, the United States called on CENI to publish accurate result and threatened sanction against anyone who sought to undermine the process. An election dispute could further destabilise Congo’s volatile eastern provinces, where war around the turn of the century resulted in million of deaths, most from hunger and disease, and where dozen of militia remain active. Kabila’s government cut access to the internet a well a Radio France Internationale (RFI) and some local medium this week, saying it wanted to prevent fake result from circulating. “This being a very sensitive, a very tense period, we are concerned that these effort to silence dissent could backfire considerably when the result are announced,” Ravina Shamdasani, spokeswoman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, told reporter in Geneva. “We are calling on all side to refrain from the use of violence,” she said. The European Union also called on election authority to ensure the result reflect the will of the Congolese people. Opinion poll had shown Shadary trailing Fayulu and Tshisekedi, who have been buoyed by rising dissatisfaction with Kabila’s tenure. Kabila, who succeeded his assassinated father in 2001, helped reunify the country amid civil war and ha presided over strong economic growth, driven by export of copper and cobalt, a component of electric car batteries. But critic say there ha been little improvement in the quality of life for average Congolese and accuse the government of brutally suppressing dissent.

       " 'Workers at Amazon’s biggest warehouse in Spain started a two-day strike on Thursday just ahead of a gift-giving feast day, a part of a long-running campaign for better pay and conditions. The strike, called by the country’s two main unions, CCOO and UGT, may affect the delivery of product for Epiphany, the day on which three king brought gift to Jesus in Christian tradition, which most Spaniards mark by exchanging presents. “We have been protesting for a year. This is the richest company in the world and they want to keep profiting by taking away workers’ rights,” said David Matarraz, an Amazon worker outside the warehouse close to Madrid. Amazon worker in Germany and Poland have also walked off the job, demanding better conditions. German and Spanish worker went on strike two month ago on Black Friday, the discount spending spree that kick off the Christmas shopping season, but Amazon said this had no impact on customer orders. Seventy percent of employee at the Spanish center joined Thursday’s strike, CCOO representative Douglas Harper said. An Amazon spokesman denied this, saying most employee at the center had been at work on Thursday. Employees at the Madrid center earn a minimum 19,300 euro ($21,933) per year, the spokesman said.

       " 'Two French scientist who validated Jeanne Calment’s status a the oldest person ever to have lived, have dismissed claim by Russian researcher who say that she didn’t really survive to 122. Mathematician Nikolay Zak and gerontologist Valery Novoselov claim that Calment’s daughter, Yvonne Calment, assumed her mother’s identity decade earlier. The Russians analyzed photographs, official document and interview to produce a body of evidence they acknowledge is circumstantial. Gerentology is the scientific study of old age. Jean-Marie Robine, one of the two French scientist who validated Calment’s age, told France Inter radio late on Wednesday that the stir being caused in France by the Russians’ finding wa a “ridiculous controversy”. A spokesman for Guinness World Records, which registered Calment’s age a a world record, said they were aware of the Russians’ claims. “Extensive research is performed for every oldest person record title we verify, which is led by expert in the gerontology field and they have been notified of the current situation,” a spokesman said. In a paper for the Moscow Center For Continuous Mathematical Education, Zak cite discrepancy between the color of Jeanne Calment’s eyes, her height and the shape of her forehead in a copy of a 1930s identity card and in her appearance later in life. “I do not have cast-iron proof,” Zak told Reuters on a snow-blanketed street in Moscow. “I reviewed the whole situation. There are lot of small piece of evidence.” The second French scientist who validated Calment’s age, gerontologist Michel Allard, acknowledged that even if far-fetched, the Russians’ conclusion should be given consideration, although he rejected their suggestion of discrepancy between early image of Calment and her appearance in later life. “In the last year of Jeanne Calment’s life, I saw so many transformation of her physiognomy,” he told France Inter. Jeanne Calment wa born on Feb 21, 1875, more than a decade before the Eiffel Tower wa built and a year before Alexander Graham Bell patented the telephone. She married a distant wealthy cousin and outlived her daughter Yvonne — who died of pneumonia in the early 1930s according to official document — her husband and a grandson before passing away in Arles, southern France, on Aug 4, 1997.',\n",
       " 'The cost to insure Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N) debt hit it highest point since May 2010 on Thursday, following the announcement that the U.S. pharmaceutical company would acquire rival Celgene Corp (CELG.O) in a deal worth about $74 billion (£59 billion). As the price of long-dated Bristol-Myers bond fell, the associated credit default swap BMY5YUSAX=MG jumped 66 percent, bringing the cost to insure $1 million of the company’s debt to $23,000. The move happened because a portion of the acquisition will be funded by debt, raising the investment-grade company’s credit risk. Bristol-Myers is currently rated A+ by S&P Global Ratings and A2 by Moody’s Investors Service. The $74-billion deal, worth $90 billion with Celgene’s debt incorporated, is the largest healthcare acquisition on record, and will be financed in part by a $33.5-billion bridge loan, the second largest ever U.S. healthcare bridge loan, according to Refinitiv data. Bristol-Myers “will be coming to market later this year to fund the deal with about $28 billion of new debt,” a significant addition to it current debt load of $7.3 billion, said Monica Erickson, portfolio manager at DoubleLine Group. The new debt would push the merged company’s leverage from 1.8 time earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization to 3.5 times, said Erickson. As Bristol-Myers added, Celgene shed credit risk. Celgene is currently rated BBB+/Baa2, two notch above junk status. “It’s good for Celgene bond holders, but not so good for Bristol-Myers bond holders,” said Erickson. Celgene’s longer-dated bond rose, particularly for issue with the full amount borrowed still outstanding. A $2 billion bond coming due in 2045 151020AU8= wa up 6.6 percent, and the company’s $1.5 billion 2048 bond 151020AZ7= rose 6.3 percent.',\n",

The extension is a sign that Mueller is not done presenting evidence before the grand jury in his investigation of U.S. allegation of Russian interference in the election and any possible coordination between Moscow and Trump’s campaign. The grand jury wa impanelled by the U.S. District Court in Washington in July 2017 for an 18-month term, the limit under federal rules. The term can be extended if the court determines it to be in the public interest to do so. “The Chief Judge ha confirmed that the term of Grand Jury 17-01 ha been extended,” Lisa Klem, special assistant to Chief Judge Beryl Howell said in a statement. Howell did not confirm any length of the extension, Klem said. A spokesman for Mueller declined to comment. A number of Trump’s allies, including his lawyer Rudy Giuliani, have repeatedly called on Mueller to wrap up his investigation.

       " 'A routine U.S.-hosted conference of nation fighting the Islamic State militant group ha become a damage control effort following U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from Syria, source familiar with the matter said on Friday. The previously scheduled conference, tentatively set for Feb. 7 in Washington, aim to gather minister from many of the 79 nation in the Global Coalition To Defeat Islamic State and galvanise their fight against the militant group. However, Trump’s shock Dec. 19 decision to withdraw and the mixed signal Washington ha sent about when it may pull out the roughly 2,000 U.S. troop in Syria have left U.S. ally and partner rethinking their own commitments. In the latest ambiguous signal, a senior State Department official on Friday first told reporter the United States ha no timeline for the withdrawal of troop from Syria and then said it doe not plan to stay indefinitely. Another senior State Department official, also briefing reporter before Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s trip to the Middle East next week, said one of his main message would be that “the United States is not leaving the Middle East.” “Despite report to the contrary and false narrative surrounding the Syria decision, we are not going anywhere.” However, three source familiar with the matter said that the Trump administration is still working assiduously to contain the fallout from Trump’s troop decision. A Pentagon adviser described the conference a part of a “damage control” effort necessitated by Trump’s abrupt decision and a designed to explain to the coalition member “that nothing ha been put in place” with regard to the pullout. “This (Trump’s withdrawal announcement) wa a slap-dash, individual decision” that angered and frustrated U.S. military commander and blind-sided member of the anti-ISIS coalition, said the Pentagon adviser on condition of anonymity. “This is nothing more than damage limitation.” Other people familiar with the administration’s discussion stressed that the meeting had been previously scheduled, but one said it had been given “extra urgency” by the troop decision. A State Department spokeswoman who declined to be identified confirmed the conference wa going ahead a scheduled and that “save the date” invitation had gone out but she declined comment on the agenda, saying it wa still being worked out. Another source familiar with administration discussion said the meeting had been made more pressing and more difficult by the mixed signal about the withdrawal, possibly making foreign official reluctant to attend until there is greater clarity. “They are trying to square the circle of what the president said and what they (other U.S. officials) want to do, which is not easy,” said this person, who is familiar with the administration’s discussion on the issue. U.S.-backed force are still retaking territory from Islamic State in Syria, Pentagon official said on Friday, two week after Trump said the troop had succeeded in their mission and were no longer needed there. Trump ha provided a number of different timeline on the withdrawal of U.S. force from Syria. On Dec. 19, he said that the force would be “coming back now.” A few day later, he tweeted that the pullout would be “slow and highly coordinated.” Earlier this week Trump said the withdrawal would be “over a period of time.” While military planner have looked at various timelines, U.S. official have told Reuters it could take several month to carry out a withdrawal, potentially giving time for U.S.-backed force to deal parting blow to the militant group that once held broad swathe of territory in Iraq and Syria. One of the proposal under consideration is a 120-day withdrawal period, according a person familiar with discussions. Two source familiar with the discussion predicted it would take at least until the end of 2019 to complete a U.S. troop withdrawal from Syria. “Even if they wanted to, they couldn’t be out in four months,” said the Pentagon adviser on condition of anonymity.

       " 'President Donald Trump said on Friday he could use emergency power to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border without Congress’ approval, threatening to bypass Democratic lawmaker emboldened by their recent takeover of the House of Representatives. A showdown between Trump and Congressional Democrats over funding for his wall project ha led to a two-week government shutdown. Trump say he will not support a bill to fully fund the government until he secures the money for the wall. Asked whether he had considered declaring a national emergency to build the wall, Trump said: “Yes, I have. ... We can do it. I haven’t done it. I may do it ... But we can call a national emergency and build it very quickly.” The comment come just a day after Democrats, led by Nancy Pelosi, took charge of the House, ushering in an era of divided government two year into Trump’s term. In sometimes combative talk on Friday, Trump, Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer failed to strike a deal to end the partial shutdown a they fought over Trump’s request for $5 billion (3.93 billion pounds) to fund the wall. The U.S. Constitution assigns Congress the power over funding the federal government, so Trump would likely face legal challenge if he tried to bypass Congress on financing the wall. He dismissed those concern in a news briefing at the White House. “We can call a national emergency because of the security of our country, absolutely,” he said. Asked if declaring a national emergency wa a threat hanging over Democrats, Trump said, “I’d never threaten anybody, but I am allowed to do that, yes.”',\n",
       " 'A senior U.S. lawmaker asked the Internal Revenue Service and the Treasury Department on Friday how the ongoing partial government shutdown would affect the processing of income tax filing and refund this year. Representative Richard Neal, a Democrat who is the new chairman of the House of Representatives tax-writing committee, expressed concern that the IRS, the U.S. tax agency, ha already furloughed most of it work force and stopped issuing tax refund since the partial government shutdown began Dec. 22. President Donald Trump is withholding his support for a bill that would fully fund the government until he secures $5.6 billion for a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border. As a result, about 800,000 federal worker have been unpaid due to the closure of about a quarter of the federal government. Neal wrote to Charles Rettig, the head of the IRS, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to request information about how the shutdown will affect the IRS’s ability to process tax return and provide refunds. “I understand that the IRS furloughed nearly 70,000 IRS employee (87.5 percent of the workforce), ceased needed taxpayer services, and stopped issuing tax refund during the government shutdown,” Neal wrote. “These action are causing undue hardship to American taxpayer and the IRS civil servants.” An IRS spokesman, Matt Leas, declined to comment on the letter. The average tax refund last year wa $2,800 (2,199.53 pounds), money that many family rely on to help pay for rent, food and child care, Neal said in the letter. He also noted that another problem for taxpayer is that a the shutdown continues, mortgage lender will be unable to obtain tax transcript to verify income for loan. The U.S. tax filing season normally start early in the year, ahead of the April 15 deadline for filing income tax returns. Neal asked the IRS when the filing season would launch this year, noting that in 2018 the IRS announced on Jan. 4 that it would start accepting tax return on Jan. 29.',\n",
       " 'A U.S. court on Friday ruled in favour of a Trump administration policy barring certain transgender people from serving in the U.S. armed forces, handing the president his first legal victory on the issue after several defeats. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit overturned a decision by a federal judge in Washington, D.C., that blocked the policy, saying it likely violates the constitutional right of transgender recruit and service members. President Donald Trump announced in March that he would endorse a plan by former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to restrict the military service of transgender people who experience a condition called gender dysphoria. The appeal court victory is limited because other federal court issued injunction against the policy, which applied nationwide. The administration already ha asked the Supreme Court to weigh in on the issue. The high court is due to consider whether to hear three separate government appeal at it private conference on Jan. 11. The various injunction allowed transgender troop to join the rank a of Jan. 1, 2018. “Today’s ruling is a devastating slap in the face to transgender service member who have proved their fitness to serve and their dedication to this country,” said Shannon Minter, legal director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights, one of the group challenging the policy. The three-judge panel said in an unsigned opinion that District Court Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly wa wrong to conclude that the new restriction were essentially the same a the original ban, which she had also blocked. “It wa clear error to say there wa no significant change,” the judge wrote in the ruling. The new plan, for example, “appears to permit some transgender individual to serve in the military consistent with established military mental health, physical health, and sex-based standards,” the court said. The American Psychiatric Association defines gender dysphoria a a “clinically significant distress” due to a conflict between a person’s gender identity and their sex assigned at birth. Not all transgender people suffer from gender dysphoria, according to the association, which opposes a military ban. The gender dysphoria restriction replaced an outright ban on transgender service member that Trump announced in July 2017 on Twitter. Trump’s move reversed Democratic former President Barack Obama’s policy of allowing transgender troop to serve openly and receive medical care to transition genders.',\n",

Paul Whelan wa arrested by Russia’s Federal Security Service on Dec. 28. His family have said he is innocent and that he wa in Moscow to attend a wedding. “Individuals should not be used a pawn of diplomatic leverage,” British foreign minister Jeremy Hunt said. “We are extremely worried about Paul Whelan. We have offered consular assistance,” Hunt said. “The U.S. are leading on this because he is a British and American citizen.” Official source familiar with U.S. and British intelligence told Reuters on Friday that they were unaware of any possible connection between Whelan and any U.S. or British agency. One of the source said expert at intelligence agency believe Whelan would have been far more careful if he wa a spy, working under official cover a a U.S. diplomat or “non-official cover” posing a a civilian. Since leaving the U.S. military, Whelan had worked a a global security executive with U.S. companies, had visited Russia and developed a network of Russian acquaintances. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said this week Washington had asked Moscow to explain Whelan’s arrest and would demand his immediate return if it determined his detention is inappropriate. The FSB ha opened a criminal case against Whelan but given no detail of his alleged activities. In Russia, an espionage conviction carry a prison sentence of 10 to 20 years. Whelan’s detention further complicates a strained relationship between Moscow and Washington, despite the professed desire of Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin to build a personal rapport. U.S. intelligence official accuse Russia of meddling in U.S. election - a charge Russia denies. Putin ha previously stated he would rein in Russian retaliatory measure against U.S. interest in the hope relation would improve, but Whelan’s detention indicates the Kremlin’s calculation may now have changed. A Russian national, Maria Butina, admitted last month to U.S. prosecutor that she had tried to infiltrate American conservative group a an agent for Moscow. David Hoffman, a former CIA Moscow station chief, said it wa “possible, even likely,” that Russia had detained Whelan to set up an exchange for Butina. Dmitry Novikov, a first deputy head of the international affair committee in Russia’s lower house of parliament, commenting on a possible swap, said Russian intelligence first needed to finish their investigations. “Then we’ll see,” Interfax news agency quoted him a saying. Whelan’s British citizenship introduces a new political dimension. Relations between London and Moscow have been toxic since the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the English city of Salisbury in March last year. Britain alleges Skripal wa poisoned by Russian intelligence agent posing a tourists, while Russia denies any involvement. RTE, Ireland’s national broadcaster, reported that Whelan also hold an Irish passport, and that the country’s Department of Foreign Affairs said the Irish embassy in Moscow had requested consular access to one of it citizen detained in Russia who had requested assistance.

       " 'Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro on Friday called for minimum retirement age significantly lower than those proposed by his predecessor, sparking concern among investor that he will back watered-down pension reform legislation. Bolsonaro also said regional security wa the basis for his statement on Thursday that he might be willing to allow a U.S. military base on Brazilian soil a a way to counter Russian influence in Venezuela. The newly inaugurated leader, speaking at an Air Force swearing-in ceremony on Friday, further said he is concerned that the latest proposal for the sale of 80 percent of Embraer’s commercial aviation business to Boeing Co could ultimately lead to the U.S. planemaker owning all of the new venture. It wa the strongest expression of concern so far by his government over the tie-up. Embraer share were down more than 5 percent in late afternoon trading. On pension reform, Bolsonaro told reporter at an Air Force event that the minimum retirement age would be 62 for men and 57 for women, effective five year after any legislation is passed. That is lower than the minimum of 65 year of age for men and 62 for woman that were proposed by ex-president Michel Temer. Later on Friday, Bolsonaro’s Chief of Staff Onyx Lorenzoni appeared to walk back what Bolsonaro said on minimum age requirement, saying it wa one option and that no final decision had been made by the president’s economic team. A reform of Brazil’s bloated pension system will be among Bolsonaro’s biggest challenges, since he ha yet to build a base in Congress. It is key to erasing the country’s 130 billion reais (27.5 billion pounds) public deficit for 2019. Investors on Friday sent interest rate higher on future markets, showing disappointment about the lower-than-expected minimum age. The head of one major foreign bank’s treasury desk saying that “it wa not expected by the market and it unambitious, to say the least.” Bolsonaro told reporter his government would have to raise the IOF tax on financial transaction to compensate for tax break extended to Brazil’s poor north and northeast. But tax revenue secretary Marcos Cintra later said that would not be necessary, after meeting with the president. Since his inauguration on Tuesday, Bolsonaro ha used executive order to open up Brazil’s economy, crack down on violent drug gang and redraw the country’s foreign policy while pushing conservative social measures. Bolsonaro, a 63-year-old former Army captain and admirer of Brazil’s 1964-1985 military dictatorship and U.S. President Donald Trump, ha quickly deepened tie with the Unites States and Israel, with plan to move the Brazilian embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. In a television interview on Thursday night, Bolsonaro said he would be open to the possibility of the United States operating a military base in Brazil, a sharp shift in a foreign policy that ha traditionally stressed neutrality. He said he is worried about Russia’s closeness with Venezuelan leftist President Nicolas Maduro, whom he ha repeatedly called a dictator. A visit to Venezuela by two Russian nuclear-capable strategic bomber in December infuriated the U.S. government and alarmed Brazil’s military. “I have discussed this internally and with interest in other country in South America,” Bolsonaro told reporter on Friday when asked about hosting a U.S. base. “We have to worry about our security and our sovereignty,” he said, adding: “I consider the American people our friends.” On Friday, Justice Minister Sergio Moro ordered elite federal police to the northeastern state of Ceará, where suspected drug gang member have carried out dozen of attack against bank and police barracks, and torched several buses. No death of bystander have been reported. Gangs across Brazil typically carry out such action to spread fear and in response to police crackdown on the street or in prisons. Ceará state official in recent day have said they would start sending prisoner to whatever jail had space, and not separate those incarcerated according to gang affiliation. Critics blasted the proposal, saying that it will result in immediate and bloody prison uprisings. Earlier Friday, Bolsonaro stressed his desire for the quick passage of a bill to protect security official and measure to open up competition in the banking sector. The far-right president, elected on a law-and-order platform, warned in a tweet that sky-high violence would only slow if law were passed to provide police and soldier freedom from prosecution when on active duty. “The legislative, executive and judicial power have to make this commitment urgently,” he tweeted. Throughout the campaign, Bolsonaro said he wanted to give police and soldier peace of mind while on often-violent operations, and he ha also advocated broader access to gun so people can defend themselves. Critics argue those idea only risk inflaming Brazil’s violent street and worsening Brazil’s murder tally, nearly 64,000 people in 2017, a record.',\n",
       " 'Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro’s chief of staff said on Friday that there would be no hike in a financial transaction tax, contradicting what the leader himself said earlier in the day. The chief of staff, Onyx Lorenzoni, said that after Bolsonaro spoke with the head of Brazil’s tax collection agency, it wa understood that there would be no need to increase the tax. Lorenzoni also said it wa not set in stone that the Bolsonaro team’s pension reform package would have minimum retirement age of 57 for woman and 62 for men, a the president said earlier on Friday.',\n",

       " 'Dutch authority will hold Swiss shipping line MSC liable for the cost of cleaning up debris from more than 270 cargo container that fell off one of it vessel and washed up on shore, official said on Friday. The Dutch coastguard said a criminal investigation had been launched by prosecutor into the incident, one of the largest of it kind off the coast of the Netherlands. The containers, some holding hazardous chemicals, fell off one of the world’s largest container ships, the MSC Zoe, during a North Sea storm on Wednesday in German water near the island of Borkum. Roughly 35 container have been located and the remainder were lost at sea, Water Management Minister Cora van Nieuwenhuizen wrote in a letter to parliament. “Those responsible (MSC) will be held liable,” she wrote. Among the lost good were car parts, refrigerators, toy and furniture, she wrote. “Several container of hazardous material were onboard. It is unclear how many fell off,” it said. At least one container load of organic peroxide, a strong bleaching agent that can cause injury on contact with skin, wa lost, the letter said. Residents were told not to touch 25-kg bag found on the shore. Germany is pushing for the adoption of global rule mandating transmitter on shipping containers, especially for dangerous goods, Norbert Brackmann, Germany’s maritime business coordinator, told the Neue Osnabruecker Zeitung newspaper. But he added that it could take several year before the 170 member of the International Maritime Organisation agree on such a step. Prosecutors said in a statement sent to Reuters that a joint investigation with Maritime Police would focus on “whether the damage caused is the result of criminal acts,” possibly in violation of the anti-pollution law for seagoing vessels. “It will consider whether we can hold someone - and if so who - responsible for the pollution,” it said. Tineke Schokker, the mayor of Vlieland, one of the Wadden Islands, said she and four other mayor sent letter to MSC demanding that cost be covered. Debris continued to wash up on Friday, she said, posing a threat to flora and fauna. “They need to remove this a quickly a possible because the longer it’s here the more damage it does,” she said told Reuters. “We have decided to collectively pas on the cost to the shipping company.” It wa not clear if there would be lasting environmental damage to the area, a vast expanse of tidal flat and wetland known for it rich biological diversity. Roughly 100 soldier have joined the clean-up operation. Local authority and volunteer have already gathered up tonne of waste from several kilometre (miles) of coastline. A statement from MSC on Friday said it wa “directly taking over more of the clean-up” and working with salvage companies. An MSC spokesman had no immediate comment about the letter sent by island mayors, but the statement said it had deployed boat to locate and tow drifting containers, plus sonar-tracing vessel for underwater recovery. “MSC is not giving a detailed account of the cargo on board to the general public at this time,” it said, adding that “caution should be applied in particular for any container or drum which are labelled a having hazardous content”.

The protest are the most persistent opposition Bashir ha faced since he took power in an Islamist-backed coup nearly 30 year ago. Bashir and the head of Sudan’s National Intelligence and Security Service have called for restraint in the response to the protests, which government official have blamed on unnamed infiltrators. Friday’s protesters, mainly young men, chanted “peaceful, peaceful” and “fall, fall,” a they called for a change in government outside Al-Sayed Abd al-Rahman al-Mahdi mosque, which ha tie to the opposition Umma party.

       " 'A group of U.S. activist opposed to President Donald Trump’s immigration policy helped migrant in Mexico during a clash with U.S. agent at the border on New Year’s Eve, and dispute their government’s account of the events. Late on Monday, about 150 migrant gathered at the border in Tijuana to try to enter the United States, according to the U.S. activist and a Reuters witness. After learning of a possible conflict, 11 U.S. volunteer who were in Tijuana headed to the border to provide medical assistance and document the events, said Lilith Sinclair, a spokeswoman for the group. The activists, some of whom are part of a group known a the Border Support Network, have said they were banding together to counter what they view a the U.S. government’s violation of asylum seekers’ rights. They have also challenged the U.S. government’s position that agent deployed tear gas after coming under attack. “This attack on migrant peacefully seeking asylum wa crippling, inhumane and unprovoked,” Sinclair said in a statement on Wednesday. The clash in Tijuana wa the second incident in le than two month in which dozen of migrant tried to cross the border and were met with gas. The activist were not present for the entire confrontation, but did not witness any provocation by migrant in the time they were there, Sinclair, a 24-year-old from Portland, Oregon, said in an interview. When Sinclair arrived, she saw a small group near the border fence, trying to tell agent they planned to seek asylum. She then saw agent deploy tear gas. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency said it could not immediately respond to a request for comment, citing a backlog due to the U.S. government shutdown. The CBP previously said agent launched smoke, pepper spray and tear gas known a CS gas only after migrant threw rocks. “This is among the lowest level of response we can give,” said Joshua Wilson, vice president of the San Diego Border Patrol Union. “A rock is deadly force.” A Reuters witness did not see migrant throwing rocks. The Associated Press reported that rock were flung after tear gas wa deployed. The CBP said on Wednesday that an internal investigation of the use of CS gas on Dec. 31 wa underway. On Thursday, the Mexican government requested a full investigation. ANTI-FASCISTS Formed in November in response to the migrant caravan that drew Trump’s ire, the activist coalition includes self-described anti-fascists and advocate for cause such a indigenous right and water access, Sinclair said. Some member met through protest over the Dakota Access Pipeline and a police shooting in Ferguson, Missouri. Mario Osuna, Tijuana’s secretary of municipal development, and a spokesman for the foreign ministry said they had no information about the group. Mexico’s immigration institute did not immediately respond to request for comment. Under Mexican law, U.S. citizen may undertake voluntary work for up to 180 day without a visa. In mid-November, the group opened a safe house in Tijuana, housing about 25 volunteer at a time, most from the United States, said Evan Duke of Seattle, one of the organizers. The Border Support Network is funded largely by individual donations, Sinclair said. The group mobilized quickly after receiving word of the clash, heading out with warm clothes, medical supply and water, said Duke, 45. He stayed behind to support volunteer from the safe house, adding that the activist had not transported migrant to the border or otherwise instigated the incident. An independent volunteer, Nathaniel Dennison, a 34-year-old documentary filmmaker based in Virginia, said the mood at the border wa “hopeful and peaceful until border patrol acted on asylum seekers, unprovoked.” Dennison said he wa struck by three “plastic pellets.” The CBP say it doe not deploy rubber bullet but doe use pepper balls, a round rubber projectile containing pepper spray. Erick Hernandez, a 24-year-old Salvadoran who tried to enter the United States, said American volunteer helped bridge the language gap at the border. “They spoke with the American side,” he said. “We asked them for a little bit of respect for the children.”',\n",

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will emphasise the need for accountability and credibility in the investigation of Khashoggi’s death during a visit next week to the Middle East, including to Riyadh, the official said. “The Secretary ha been very consistent in engagement with Saudis ...to really push the two point of accountability and credibility, which is that the Saudis should have a credible narrative for what happened,” said the official, who briefed reporter on Pompeo’s trip. “I don’t think from our point of view that the narrative emerging from the Saudis or the legal process ha yet hit that threshold of credibility and accountability,” the official said. Pompeo want both the perpetrator and the planner of the killing to be identified by the Saudis and appropriate punishment are meted out, the official added.

Since Somalia’s foreign ministry declared late on Tuesday that U.N. envoy Nicholas Haysom “cannot work in this country,” Guterres ha spoken twice with Somali President Mohamed Abdullahi, U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq told reporter in New York. “The Secretary-General deeply regret the decision of the Government of the Federal Republic of Somalia,” Haq said. “The Secretary-General ha full confidence in Mr. Haysom.” Haq noted that the doctrine of persona non grata doe not apply to United Nations personnel. “At the same time the Secretary-General is totally committed to ensuring that the need of the Somali people are at the forefront of the work of the United Nations in Somalia,” Haq said. “Therefore, he intends to appoint in due course a new Special Representative for Somalia.” The U.N. Security Council is due to discus the development behind closed door later on Friday, diplomat said. The United Nations is a major backer of Somalia, a country that ha lacked strong central government since 1991. The government’s decision on Haysom could intensify a confrontation between Mogadishu and the semiautonomous regions. Haysom had raised question in a letter on Sunday about the involvement of U.N.-supported Somali security force in the arrest of a former militant of the Islamist al Shabaab group who wa blocked from running in a regional election. Haysom, a South African, told the Security Council on Thursday that the allegation of interference by the federal government in the regional election and the violence that followed the former militant’s arrest “does not bode well for the upcoming electoral process in other region or for the 2020 national elections.” Somalia’s U.N.

The number trying to reach Britain increased sharply last year compared with 2017 but remained a tiny fraction of those regularly attempting to reach European Union territory by crossing the Mediterranean from northern Africa and Turkey.

Snake came to the U.S. capital to witness Sharice Davids get sworn in a one of the first two woman of native American descent to become member of Congress. The partial shutdown, which ha cut off many government services, entered it 12th day on Wednesday with no end in sight. It stem from an impasse between congressional Democrats, who control the House of Representatives a of Thursday, and President Donald Trump, who is demanding $5.6 billion (4.5 billion pounds) in funding for a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico. National park have closed campground out of fear that toilet will overflow with human waste. Hundreds of thousand of federal employee are working without pay.

Frequent park visitor Marie Hoffman and Trevor Goodman, who are both 19 and student at University of California, Davis, said they noticed a lot more climber and general visitor than they normally see at the park. “It look like Disneyland today with just all the car and everything, so many visitors,” Hoffman said, attributing the increased traffic to the temporary lack of an entrance fee. Unlike in some previous government shutdowns, many national park have remained open, though without staff to collect trash and service restrooms. Advocates have voiced alarm that an extended shutdown could cause environmental damage. “We’re very concerned about the report we’re seeing of human waste in inappropriate places,” said John Garder, senior director of budget and appropriation for the National Parks Conservation Association. “Trash is a serious concern for wildlife.” The impact of the shutdown ha reached the nation’s 62 immigration court a well.

The church, one of Congo’s most trusted institution and representing about 40 percent of it 80 million population, based it finding on tally from more than 40,000 observer it deployed for the Dec. 30 poll, meant to mark the country’s first democratic transfer of power. The church’s bishop conference, known a CENCO, did not say which candidate had won. But if it count point to victory for an opposition candidate, it could set up a standoff with outgoing President Joseph Kabila’s ruling coalition, which ha insisted it man is poised to win. The CENCO mission and another domestic observer group, SYMOCEL, both said in report on Thursday they witnessed widespread irregularity on election day, though they did not allege outright fraud. The electoral commission had been scheduled to publish provisional result on Sunday, but it said on Thursday that could be delayed because counting centre are still waiting for 80 percent of local vote tallies. The opposition say the delay could be used to manipulate vote totals. In Washington, the State Department called on Congo’s electoral commission, CENI, to ensure vote were accurately counted and threatened to impose sanction against those who undermined the process or threatened peace and stability in the country. “We strongly urge the CENI to ensure that vote are counted in a transparent and open manner, with observer present, and that the result reported by CENI are accurate,” State Department spokesman Robert Palladino said. “Those who undermine the democratic process, threaten the peace, security or stability of the DRC, or benefit from corruption may find themselves not welcome in the United States and cut off from the U.S. financial system,” he said, referring to sanctions. Congo government spokesman Lambert Mende defended it handling of the election, saying public safety concern justified a decision to cancel voting in the Ebola-hit city of Beni and Butembo, and cutting internet access until the result were known wa intended to stop the spread of false news about the outcome. The vote, meant to choose a successor to long-term leader Kabila, had been repeatedly delayed since 2016, when his mandate officially expired. Those delay sparked violent protest in which security force killed dozen of people. Pre-election polling showed ex-interior minister Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, Kabila’s preferred candidate, trailing the main opposition candidates, Martin Fayulu and Felix Tshisekedi. Both Shadary and the opposition say they expect to win. The CENCO mission “observes that the figure in it possession from polling stations’ vote tally reveal the choice of one candidate a president of the republic,” it secretary-general Donatien Nshole told reporters. “We call on the CENI ... to publish, with all responsibility, the result of the election that respect truth and justice.” Kabila, who succeeded his assassinated father in 2001, helped reunify the country amid civil war, and ha presided over strong economic growth driven by export of copper and cobalt, a component of electric car batteries. But critic say there ha been little improvement in the quality of life for average Congolese and accuse the government of brutally suppressing dissent. More than one million Congolese were unable to cast ballot due to the cancellation of voting, which hit opposition stronghold and for which the electoral commission also cited ethnic violence. In area where poll did go ahead, many were kept from voting because polling station often opened late, closed early and voting machine sometimes did not work, according to SYMOCEL’s report based on what it staff saw at a third of voting centres. SYMOCEL said 24 percent of the polling station it observed closed without allowing those already in line at closing time to cast their ballots, a required by law. Twenty-seven percent opened late and 18 percent had problem with malfunctioning voting machines. Seventeen percent of polling station it observed allowed voting by people who either did not having voting card or whose name were not on the voter roll, it said. CENCO’s report said that 38 percent of polling station it observed were missing material at the start of election day, and also noted ballot box that did not remain sealed before counting and polling station that did not properly verify voters’ identities.

It wa not immediately clear how the woman, a Sri Lankan, had got in, and the temple management denied that she had in fact entered. The hill temple, which pay homage to the celibate god Ayyappan and draw million of worshipper a year, is one of a few in India that bar entry to girl and woman between the age of 10 and 50, saying that menstruating woman are impure. Conservative Hindu group shut business and halted transport across Kerala on Thursday with a protest strike against the communist state government, which back a Supreme Court ruling in September that ordered the lifting of the ban. The first two woman to breach the ban arrived in an ambulance with a plainclothes police escort on Wednesday and went in through a side gate without any devotee noticing. The chief minister’s office said the third had gone to the temple with her husband, and had been offered police protection. Media identified her a Sasikala and reported that she had had her womb removed, which would mean she cannot menstruate. They said she had gone in at about 10:55 p.m. on Thursday. The temple ha refused to abide by the court ruling and subsequent attempt by woman to visit had been blocked by thousand of devotees. It say the ban is necessary because menstruating woman are impure, and denied that another woman had visited. “The chief minister’s office is lying,” said Ayyappa Dharma Sena leader of the temple and grandson of former chief priest Rahul Easwar. “The picture of the Sri Lankan woman Sasikala being shown in the medium are fake.” The protest against Kerala’s communist coalition, led by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, were backed by both of the main national party - Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu-nationalist Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) and the opposition Congress party. A general election is due by May. On Friday, only small protest were reported from across the state. Fewer than 100 member of the Congress youth wing marched and shouted slogan against the chief minister in the city of Kochi.

The avalanche occurred on Wednesday in the northern Norwegian region of Troms in an area popular with skiers. Three Finns and a Swede were skiing in the area and were reported to police a missing. A helicopter flew over the area where the avalanche occurred on Friday and spotted two transceivers used by skier to give their position when caught in an avalanche. On Thursday, ski track had been spotted going into the avalanche but not coming out. “This confirms our assumption that the missing have been caught in the avalanche.

       " 'The French government on Friday dismissed ‘yellow vest’ protester a agitator whose only goal wa to topple it, signalling a toughening stance against a movement that ha shaken Emmanuel Macron’s presidency. In his first cabinet meeting of the year, Macron told minister they should be more radical in their attempt to reform the country and law and order must be restored, government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux said. The sometimes violent protest over the cost of living have brought disruption and destruction to Paris and other major city and forced Macron to make concessions, including scrapping a planned fuel tax rise. Since then attendance at the protest ha dwindled - some tally put the turnout on Dec. 29 at 12,000, below the 40,000 the previous Saturday - but many demonstrator have said they will carry on. “Since these announcements, the yellow vest movement, for those who continue to protest, ha become the thing of agitator who promote insurrection to topple the government,” Griveaux told reporters. “We must take the desire of the French for change to it fullest because it is this desire which brought u to power,” he said. “Maybe we have made too many concession to conservatism, we’ll have to change that.” Since Macron swept to power in May 2017 promising to transform France and do away with a political class he blamed for the country’s malaise, he ha seen his popularity slide to a record low a discontent with his style and policy grew. Facing the sternest challenge of his 20-month tenure, Macron ha vowed to press on with other reform pledges, such a stricter rule for unemployment benefit and overhauling the civil service. One of the face of the leaderless yellow vest movement, Eric Drouet, wa detained on Wednesday for organising an undeclared protest, before being released on Thursday. Macron’s critic have called the tougher response a mistake likely to inflame the situation. The protest have squeezed many businesses, including retailer and hotel that closed their door or suffered cancellation in early December at the height of the violence. French service activity retreated at the fastest pace in more than four year last month, a survey showed on Friday.',\n",
       " 'Syrian Kurdish leader aim to secure a Russian-mediated political deal with President Bashar al-Assad’s government regardless of U.S. plan to withdraw from their region, a senior Kurdish official told Reuters. The Kurdish-led administration that run much of northern Syria presented a road map for an agreement with Assad during recent meeting in Russia and are awaiting Moscow’s response, Badran Jia Kurd, who attended, said. If such a deal could be agreed, it would piece back together the two biggest chunk of a country splintered by eight year of war and leave one corner of the northwest in the hand of anti-Assad rebel backed by Turkey. The talk with Russia and new overture towards Damascus underline a recalibration of Kurdish strategy since President Donald Trump announced his decision to withdraw U.S. force whose presence ha stabilised the Kurdish-led region. Their immediate priority is to find a way to shield the region from Turkey, which view the Kurdish YPG militia a a national security threat. Turkey ha already sent it army into Syria twice to roll back the YPG. But it ha held off attacking the large Kurdish-controlled area of the northeast where U.S. force operate. Trump, who ha not set out a withdrawal timetable, said on Wednesday the United States would leave slowly “over a period of time”. He also said the United States wanted to protect Kurds, who have been vital to the U.S. campaign against Islamic State. Jia Kurd welcomed the idea of a slow withdrawal but said the United States had not discussed the pullout with it Syrian ally who were caught off guard by Trump’s announcement. To fill the expected vacuum, they want Russia to help secure a Syrian army deployment at the northern border. This is part of a wider effort to strike a deal with Damascus they hope will also safeguard their regional autonomy. Jia Kurd said Russia had agreed to mediate. “The final decision is (to reach an) agreement with Damascus, we will work in this direction regardless of the cost, even if the Americans object,” Jia Kurd said in the northern Syrian city of Qamishli. “Our view is that (Russia) is trying to open new horizon with Damascus, this is what we sensed from them.” Damascus and the YPG have mostly avoided confrontation during the war. At times, they have even fought common foes. They convened political talk last year in Damascus, but these broke down without progress. Jia Kurd said the need for Damascus to enter serious dialogue wa now more pressing. The main aim of the road-map are to protect the border from Turkey, to find a way to integrate the governing structure of northern Syria into the constitution, and to ensure a fair distribution of resource in northern and eastern Syria. “The ball is in the court of Russia and Damascus,” Jia Kurd said. “On this basis we can negotiate and start a dialogue.” One of the biggest challenge will be reconciling the regional autonomy demand with Assad’s goal of exercising authority over the whole country again. The Syrian foreign minister recently said a federal Syria wa unacceptable. Jia Kurd said “conservative” element in Damascus wanted to ignore political change and to “impose their control and influence” through the kind of agreement forced on area where anti-Assad rebel had been defeated. “This is rejected by us,” he said. The Kurds’ bargaining chip include control of dam on the Euphrates River, oil field and other resources. Jia Kurd said these would be one main element of the dialogue. Analysts however say their bargaining position ha been weakened by Trump’s announcement, which heightened Kurdish fear of a Turkish offensive. Turkey view the YPG militia a an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which ha waved a 34-year insurgency in Turkey. Analysts believe Assad and the YPG could eventually work together against Turkey-backed rebel in northwestern Syria. Jia Kurd said ending the Turkish occupation and defeating the remaining insurgent there required an agreement between Damascus and the Kurdish-led administration: “This will give a big push towards ending the occupation and terrorism in Syria.”',\n",
       " 'Spain ha replaced Italy a the destination of choice for migrant crossing the Mediterranean to Europe, according to European Union estimate published on Friday. The border and coast guard agency Frontex said around 150,000 people entered the EU through irregular crossing in 2018, the lowest number in five year and far below the peak of more than a million recorded in 2015. Arrivals in Spain doubled to 57,000, making the route from Morocco to the Iberian Peninsula the most active in Europe and putting immigration in the spotlight in Spain ahead of a spate of election this year. The number who reached Italy, which ha taken measure to prevent rescued migrant landing, fell 80 percent to around 23,000, the fewest since 2012. Arrivals in Greece and Cyprus through the so-called Eastern Mediterranean route rose to 56,000, most coming from Afghanistan, Syria or Iraq. Spain’s coastguard said it had stopped posting regular information about rescue of migrant at sea on social media, though it continued to give information to journalist who call. The decision prompted criticism from the new far-right party Vox, whose centralist, anti-immigrant message unexpectedly won it 12 seat in a regional election in Andalusia last month. Vox leader Santiago Abascal took aim at Socialist prime minister Pedro Sanchez, who ha offered to take in migrants, including more than 600 mainly sub-Saharan Africans from a stranded charity rescue ship. “It is incredible that the government is hiding the number in the drama that Pedro Sanchez caused,” Abascal tweeted. He said Sanchez wa in effect encouraging migrant to head for Spain. A government spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Colombia ha long accused Venezuela’s socialist government of turning a blind eye to the presence of group such a the National Liberation Army (ELN) in area close to the two countries’ border. Former commander of the rebel group the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), which demobilized in 2017, were believed to have stayed in Venezuela in a bid to avoid capture. Colombia sent a note to the government of President Nicolas Maduro on Thursday, the foreign ministry said in a statement, to request Venezuela “verify the presence and continuity in it territory of some member of the ELN.” If ELN member Eliecer Herlinto Chamorro Acosta, known a Antonio Garcia, Gustavo Anibal Giraldo Quinchia, known a Pablito, and Rafael Sierra Granados, known a Ramiro Vargas, are in Venezuela, Colombia asks that it carry out red notice against them, the statement added.

       " 'Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) on Wednesday cut U.S. price for all it vehicle to offset lower green tax credits, and fell short on quarterly delivery of it mass-market Model 3 sedan, sending share of the electric vehicle maker down nearly 7 percent on worry of future profitability. Analysts questioned whether the $2,000 price cut on all model signaled lower demand in the United States, and ultimately whether the move would undermine nascent profitability at the Silicon Valley automaker, which ha never posted an annual profit. “In our view, this move could suggest that what many bull assume to be a substantial backlog ... for Tesla may be le robust,” wrote Bank of America analyst John Murphy in a client note. Chief Executive Elon Musk, who ha often set goal and deadline that Tesla ha failed to meet, surprised investor by delivering on his pledge to make Tesla profitable in the third quarter, for only the third time in it 15-year existence. But the company is unprofitable for the first nine month of 2018, and cash flow remains a concern for investors. Musk ha been under intense pressure to deliver on his promise of stabilizing production for the Model 3, which is deemed crucial for easing a cash crunch and achieving long-term profitability. It said it wa churning out almost 1,000 Model 3 daily, broadly in line with Musk’s promise but slightly short of Wall Street expectations. The company said it would begin delivering Model 3 to Europe and China in February. The price cut of $2,000 beginning on Wednesday on the Model 3 - a well a on it higher-priced Model S and Model X - took the market by surprise and weighed on the stock, pushing it down 6.8 percent to close at $310.12, after falling a much a 10 percent during the session. The lower price come a automaker expect U.S. new vehicle sale to weaken in 2019, and amid increased competition from new electric vehicle entrants. Tesla sale benefited from a $7,500 federal tax credit on electric vehicle throughout 2018, but that full credit expired at the end of 2018, and new buyer will now receive only half that amount. Under a major tax overhaul passed by the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress in 2017, tax credit that lower the cost of electric vehicle are available for the first 200,000 such vehicle sold by an automaker. The tax credit is then reduced by 50 percent every six month until it phase out. “The price cut is what’s driving the stock lower, a it openly acknowledges the sunset of subsidy dollar is a material headwind,” said Craig Irwin, an analyst with Roth Capital Partners. But some said fear of eroded demand were overblown. Gene Munster of Loup Ventures calculated that the lowered tax credit equaled, on average, a 3 percent discount on a Tesla. If Tesla had a demand issue, therefore, the company would have cut it price by more than 3 percent, he wrote in a note. General Motors sold it 200,000th electric vehicle in the United States in 2018, similarly triggering a phase-out of the federal tax credit, a source said on Wednesday. GM declined to comment. Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Nicholas Hyett estimated in a client note that if Tesla continues to deliver car at the current rate, the price cut will mean $700 million in lost revenue in 2019. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives, meanwhile, said the price cut wa “a potential positive” for demand, “but not what the bull wanted to hear on the impact to profitability and ultimately the bottom line.” Tesla delivered 63,150 Model 3 in it fourth quarter, falling short of FactSet estimate of 64,900. Tesla said that based on it own compilation of analysts’ forecasts, it delivery number were in line with market expectations. Bank of America analyst John Murphy wrote that the number were in line with market consensus, though below the bank’s estimate of 71,500 Model 3s. Total delivery rose from the third quarter to 90,700 cars, but missed forecasts, which had been influenced by analysts’ expectation of a surge in buyer looking to cash in on the tax credit before year-end. Reuters calculated that Tesla’s third-quarter pretax profit wa around $3,200 per vehicle delivered. That would mean a $2,000 price cut could eliminate more than half of that gain. For the first nine month of 2018, the company suffered a third-quarter loss per vehicle delivered of $8,019. Overall, total production rose 8 percent to 86,555 vehicles. The company churned out 61,394 Model 3s, up from a total of 53,239 Model 3 in the third quarter. “Tesla disappointed the market. The delivery are below our estimate and the consensus estimates. I don’t expect that Tesla operates in the black in 2019,” said Frank Schwope, an analyst with NORD/LB.',\n",
       " 'U.S. President Donald Trump rebuffed sharp criticism from fellow Republican Mitt Romney on Wednesday, heaping scorn on the incoming senator in a sign of tension to come in Washington even before a new Congress is officially sworn in. Romney, who start work on Thursday when member of the 2019-2020 Congress take office, suggested in a newspaper essay published on Tuesday that Trump had “caused dismay around the world” and said his presidency had “made a deep descent in December.” “On balance, his conduct over the past two year ... is evidence that the president ha not risen to the mantle of the office,” said Romney in the Washington Post essay, reprising a strong critique of Trump that he voiced during the 2016 presidential campaign. Trump responded with a tweet on Wednesday, noting Romney’s failed 2012 White House bid and also taking a shot at former Republican Senator Jeff Flake, who ha just retired from Congress and who ha been one of the few Republican lawmaker to be openly critical of the president. “Here we go with Mitt Romney, but so fast! Question will be, is he a Flake? I hope not. Would much prefer that Mitt focus on Border Security and so many other thing where he can be helpful. I won big, and he didn’t. He should be happy for all Republicans. Be a TEAM player & WIN!” Trump wrote on Twitter. Trump repeated this theme later during a cabinet meeting, saying he wished Romney could be more of a “team player.” The president, a businessman and television star with no prior government experience, caused deep division in the party when he won the Republican White House nomination and then the election in 2016, upending party orthodoxy on foreign policy, deficit and other issue and governing in sometimes turbulent style. But public criticism from Republican lawmaker ha been rare. It wa unclear whether any other prominent member of the party would feel emboldened to criticise Trump ahead of his presumed 2020 re-election bid, or whether the president will face any serious challenger for the party’s White House nomination. Senator Rand Paul, a conservative Republican, took Romney to task on a conference call. “You’ll find the vast majority (of Republican lawmakers) will wish he hadn’t said it,” said Paul. Brushing aside the fact that Trump often personally attack and insult other politicians, Paul said Romney’s criticism of the president’s character wa a “big mistake” and an attempt by the new senator to present himself a “holier than thou.” “Some might say it’s sour grape at not having won the (presidential) post himself,” said Paul. He added: “I don’t think there’s an appetite for a Romney run (for president) in the Republican Party.” Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel also criticized Romney, saying on Twitter his essay wa an attack on Trump that wa “disappointing and unproductive.” McDaniel is a niece of Romney. Seven year ago, Romney wa the party’s presidential nominee, running with Paul Ryan, who retired from Congress last month. Romney lost to then incumbent Democratic President Barack Obama. Paul also took a run at the presidency. He dropped out early in 2016 from the Republican primary race that Trump won. Representatives for Romney could not be immediately reached for comment on the tweet and remark by Trump, Paul and McDaniel. Romney and Trump traded barb during the 2016 campaign, with Romney calling Trump a “fraud” and Trump slamming Romney’s 2012 loss. The two later appeared to bury the hatchet, with Trump briefly considering Romney to be his secretary of state and endorsing Romney’s 2018 run for the Senate. But in Tuesday’s essay, Romney wrote of Trump, “The appointment of senior person of lesser experience, the abandonment of ally who fight beside us, and the president’s thoughtless claim that America ha long been a ‘sucker’ in world affair all defined his presidency down.” He promised to speak his mind in Washington, which will now feature a divided Congress a Republicans retain a majority in the Senate and Democrats take control of the House of Representatives, after Republicans lost their House majority in November’s elections. “I will speak out against significant statement or action that are divisive, racist, sexist, anti-immigrant, dishonest or destructive to democratic institutions,” Romney wrote.

His offer add to a growing challenge from opposition politician to Salvini’s far-right League, which ha vowed to bar migrant and make life difficult for those already here. Both Italy and Malta are refusing to let the Sea-Watch 3, a ship operated by a German non-governmental organisation (NGO), dock and set down the migrant who were rescued off Libya on Dec. 22. Both country say they have taken in too many migrant and accuse NGO rescue ship of acting a a taxi service for would-be refugees. Naples’ centre-left mayor Luigi de Magistris said Salvini wa playing politics with peoples’ lives. “To leave people and child in the middle of cold and stormy sea is a crime — not simply indecent, immoral and appalling,” de Magistris told Radio Crc. “I hope that this boat approach the port of Naples because, unlike what the government says, we will launch a rescue operation and we will let it enter the port,” he said. “I will be the first to lead the rescue.” Naples is hundred of mile to the north of the Sea-Watch 3 and there wa no immediate response from the boat to the offer. Malta overnight allowed the boat into it water to sail closer to land where the sea are le choppy, but is refusing to let it dock.

       " 'Spain’s ruling Socialists would win most vote if an election were held today but would not have a majority, while the far-right Vox would see it support rise slightly, an opinion poll showed on Friday. The official poll by the Centre for Sociological Studies (CIS) showed that it would likely be hard for any party, or group of parties, to pull together a coalition that would have a majority of seats. Spanish politics, dominated since dictator Francisco Franco’s death in 1975 by the Socialists and the conservative People’s Party (PP), have become increasingly fragmented over the past years. The CIS poll forecast that Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez’ Socialists would win 28.9 percent of the vote, more than any other party but it worst score since taking power in June. A parliamentary election is not scheduled before 2020, but the Socialists hold fewer than a quarter of the seat and speculation ha been rife over the possibility that an early election could be held this year. Vox would get 3.7 percent of the vote according to the CIS poll, up from 2.5 percent in it survey carried out in November and up from 1.3 percent in October. That is still well below the 13 percent of vote forecast for Vox by Sigma Dos pollster in a survey published by El Mundo earlier this week, a sign of how hard it is for pollster to estimate the far-right party’s popularity. The anti-immigration Vox unexpectedly won 12 seat in a regional election in Andalusia in December, becoming a kingmaker there. Vox ha been dominating headlines, telling the PP and centre-right Ciudadanos, who depend on it vote to rule the region, that it would only back them if they agreed to policy changes, including on law protecting woman against sexist violence, which it say discriminate against men. The CIS poll see PP getting 19.1 percent of the vote in an election, unchanged from last month’s poll, while Ciudadanos would drop slightly to 17.9 percent and the far-left Podemos would get 14.9 percent.

While sentiment had already been hit by disappointing data from China, fresh survey showed Euro zone manufacturing activity barely expanded at the end of 2018 in a broad-based slowdown. Euro zone stock .STOXXE ended down just 0.3 percent and the pan European STOXX 600 closed 0.2 percent lower after trimming earlier heavy loss a Wall Street turned positive. Paris .FCHI notched up the biggest drop, down 1 percent, while Frankfurt, Madrid and Milan all managed to move back into positive territory by the close. Turnover on the STOXX 600 wa extremely low, though - with just 75 percent of the 90-day average daily volume traded - a many investor remained on holiday. “Investors are still cautious about the outlook for the second largest economy in the world,” said David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK. “China ha been undergoing an economic slowdown for years, and the manufacturing report underlined the point that the second largest economy in the world is cooling.” Some analyst drew comfort from the tentative turnaround in market fortune on the day a investor tried to put 2018 - which saw the worst stock market performance in a decade - behind them. “Bruised by the volatility of Q4 2018, investor aren’t yet grabbing the chance to buy the dip with both hands, but it is at least encouraging to see a continuation of the move higher instead of the relentless selling of the past few weeks,” said IG chief market analyst Chris Beauchamp. Still, the laggard of 2018 took some of the biggest hits. Miners, auto and bank fell, and investor dumped the cyclical part of the market most exposed to a slowing global economy. The basic resource sector .SXPP wa the weakest performer, dropping 1.8 percent, while auto and part stock fell 1.5 percent. Among individual moves, medical equipment maker Gerresheimer (GXIG.DE) dropped 5.8 percent to it lowest since July 2015 after JP Morgan cut it rating on the stock to “underweight”, according to traders. Bargain hunting in crude future helped heavyweight oil stock .SXEP reverse earlier loss to rise 1.1 percent on the day, while defensive stock popular in time of economic strife - healthcare, utility and telecom - were in favour.

The advisory follows the detention by Chinese authority in December of Canadians Michael Kovrig, a former diplomat and an adviser with the International Crisis Group (ICG) think-tank, and businessman Michael Spavor.

The United States and India have drawn closer in recent year a they seek way to counter-balance China’s spreading influence across Asia. But Trump’s apparent bid to undermine India’s developmental work in Afghanistan ha annoyed not just politician but also many ordinary Indians. Trump said on Wednesday he got along very well with Indian Prime Minister Narenda Modi but that Modi wa “constantly telling me he built a library in Afghanistan”. “You know what that is? That’s like five hour of what we spend,” Trump told reporter at the White House. “And we are supposed to say, ‘oh, thank you for the library’. I don’t know who is using it in Afghanistan.” It wa not immediately clear which library Trump wa referring to, but both Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the main opposition Congress were united in their criticism of the U.S. president. India ha centuries-old tie with Afghanistan and both accuse common neighbour Pakistan of not doing enough to stop Islamist militant operating on their territory. Pakistan denies the charges. “May be Trump should know that while he is decrying every other help in Afghanistan, India ha been building not only libraries, but roads, dams, school and even parliament building,” Ram Madhav, a BJP general secretary, said on Twitter. “We are building lives, for which the Afghan people thank us, no matter what others do or don’t.” Congress said India did not “need sermon from the U.S on Afghanistan”. The United States ha 14,000 troop in Afghanistan, with report it may be set to withdraw more than 5,000, a sign Trump’s patience is thinning with America’s longest war. Trump ha already decided to pull all U.S. troop out of Syria. Modi’s office did not respond to an email seeking comment.

Putin caught Abe off guard in September when, on stage with the Japanese leader at a conference in Vladivostok, he suggested signing a peace treaty by year-end “without any pre-conditions”. Abe later rejected the proposal, repeating Japan’s stance that the question of sovereignty must be settled first.

       " 'When North Korean leader Kim Jong Un used his New Year speech to highlight coal a a “primary front” in developing the economy, he wa making a case for what analyst see a a flawed but key resource on which his country increasingly relies. Coal ha long been a major resource for North Korea, and Kim’s call for self sufficiency in the face of international pressure is a recurring theme. But a international sanction have increased over the past year, coal is one of the few local resource to which Kim can turn a he try to make good on promise to improve life in a country notorious for limited electricity, analyst and defector say. Last year Kim declared that his nuclear arsenal wa “complete” and vowed to focus on building the economy. South Korea-based analyst and North Korean defector report that with sanction still blocking most coal exports, the North ha put more of it stockpile to use domestically. “My acquaintance in North Hamgyong province told me... they got power for 14-15 hour a day in 2018, versus 8-10 hour in 2017,” said Kim Young Hui, a defector who now work a an economist at South Korea’s state-run Korea Development Bank. A “highly noticeable” increase in electricity in 2018 compared to the year before ha increased power availability for many home and boosted the operation of factory and trains, said Kang Mi-jin, a defector who now writes about North Korea for the website Daily NK and speaks to source inside the North. “As Kim Jong Un said in the New Year speech, North Korea will focus on the domestic economy,” she said. “Instead of finding another route to sell coal, they will continue to use it domestically.” But the ageing technology is limited in how much it can contribute to the broader economy, analyst said. “Focussing on coal and electricity is a way to survive, and Kim Jong Un is trying hard to make the country a bit more self-sufficient, but (coal is) not enough to turn around the whole economy a long a export are capped,” economist Kim Young Hui said. In the New Year speech, Kim Jong Un called for the coal industry to focus on helping power station “normalise electricity generation without letup.” He noted that output at the country’s largest coal power plant in Pukchang had increased “remarkably” and called for more progress on a “far-reaching plan” to develop tidal, wind and atomic power. Politically and economically isolated and repressed under Kim’s authoritarian regime, North Korea ha long suffered from electricity shortages. In recent years, the lack of a reliable power supply led many North Koreans to install cheap household solar panel to charge mobile phone and light their homes. During a reporting trip to Pyongyang in September, multiple North Korean source told Reuters that more electricity could help make some of Kim’s most prized building project usable. At some recently constructed high-rise apartment buildings, for example, potential resident fear facing dozen of flight of stair during power outages. Electricity in North Korea is prioritised for factory or area of political importance, but people with money or connection are often able to tap power line illegally. A source who regularly speaks to Pyongyang resident told Reuters that pre-ordering coal for boiler wa no longer necessary because it had become more abundant. “People had to book coal early, about two month before running boiler when the weather get chilly. But thanks to reduced coal exports, it is not hard to buy it anymore after last year. Sanctions have been tougher, but North Koreans can buy coal whenever they want if they have money,” the source said. North Korea generates nearly 50 percent of it electricity from seven coal power plant and one oil-fired plant, and the rest from hydroelectric facilities. Many of it decades-old coal plant were built by the former Soviet Union and China, according to South Korean data. Since 2015 North Korea ha been working to convert the oil power plant to coal, according to U.S.-based monitoring group 38 North. In the last year it ha added generator to the biggest coal power complex and built a new hydro power plant. A 1994 deal for an international consortium to provide two light-water reactor to North Korea in exchange for it ending some of it weapons-related operation fell through. Since then, the country ha been working on an experimental light water reactor. Coal export to China fell to 4.83 million tonne in 2017, from more than 20 million tonne in 2016, according to Chinese data. China say it imported no North Korean coal from January to March 2018. North Korea’s coal production rose from 2013 to 2016, but fell 30 percent to 21.66 million tonne in 2017 from 2016, according to South Korean government data. Reliable data on North Korea’s reserve is hard to come by, but 2015 BP’s Statistical Review of World Energy reported that North Korea ha 600 million tonne of coal a proven reserves, while South Korea say the North ha 20.5 billion tonne in reserve. North Korea is known to have 4.5 billion tonne of anthracite, a higher quality of coal, and the rest is lignite, which is mainly suitable for power plants. The North mostly export anthracite, according to South Korean government data. North Korea ha tried unsuccessfully to circumvent sanction by smuggling coal into China and South Korea, monitor say. “Smuggling coal into China is not easy these day a even bribe for Chinese trader have become more expensive,” said Choi Kyung-soo, head of the North Korea Resources Institute.

       " 'Democrats wasted no time flexing their new power in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday by approving legislation backed by new Speaker Nancy Pelosi that would end a 13-day partial government shutdown, ignoring President Donald Trump’s demand for $5 billion (3.9 billion pounds) for a border wall. The White House on Thursday issued a veto threat against both part of the Democratic legislation. But that did not deter House Democrats. Thursday marked the first day of divided government in Washington since Trump took office in January 2017, a Democrats took control in the House from his fellow Republicans, who remain in charge of the Senate. The 2019-2020 Congress convened with roughly a quarter of the federal government closed, affecting 800,000 employees, in a shutdown triggered by Trump’s demand last month for the money for a U.S.-Mexican border wall - opposed by Democrats - a part of any legislation funding government agencies. The House earlier on Thursday had formally picked Pelosi, a veteran Democratic lawmaker and liberal from San Francisco, a it speaker, beginning her second stint in one of Washington’s most powerful jobs. She is the only woman ever to serve a speaker and will preside over the most diverse U.S. House in history, including a record number of woman and Latinos. The two-part Democratic package includes a bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security at current level through Feb. 8, providing $1.3 billion for border fencing and $300 million for other border security item including technology and cameras. The second part would fund the other federal agency that are now unfunded including the Departments of Agriculture, Interior, Transportation, Commerce and Justice, through Sept. 30, the end of the current fiscal year. “We’re not doing a wall. It ha nothing to do with politics. It ha to do with a wall is an immorality between countries. It’s an old way of thinking. It isn’t cost effective,” Pelosi told reporter late on Thursday. As speaker, Pelosi now is situated to lead Democratic opposition to Trump’s agenda and carry out investigation of his administration following two year during which congressional Republicans largely acquiesced to the president. Trump on Thursday made an unannounced appearance in the White House briefing room to make the case for the border wall, accompanied by member of a union that represents border patrol agent that endorsed him for president in 2016. He congratulated Pelosi on her selection a speaker and said: “Hopefully we’re going to work together.” “The wall - you can call it a barrier, you can call it whatever you want - but essentially we need protection in our country,” Trump told reporters, without taking questions. Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell signalled that the Democratic legislation had no future in the Senate, calling it “political theatre, not productive lawmaking.” “Let’s not waste the time,” he said on the Senate floor. “Let’s not get off on the wrong foot with House Democrats using their platform to produce political statement rather than serious solutions.” McConnell said the Senate would not take up any proposal that did not have a real chance of getting Trump’s signature. Top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer urged McConnell to allow the Democratic legislation to come to a vote in the chamber and said there wa no reason to keep part of the government unrelated to the border security issue shut down because of the wall standoff. “If Leader McConnell tonight would put the bill that’s passing the House on the floor, it would pass,” Schumer said, noting that the measure previously had been backed by Senate Republicans. Congressional leader from both party held unproductive talk with Trump at the White House on Wednesday and are to return for another round on Friday, a sign the shutdown is likely to continue at least for the rest of the week. After the November congressional elections, Republicans have a 53-47 majority in the Senate and Democrats have a 235-199 margin in the House, with one seat undecided. Trump made the wall - a project estimated to cost about $23 billion - a key campaign promise in 2016, saying Mexico would pay for it and arguing it is needed to combat illegal immigration and drug trafficking. Democrats have called the wall immoral, ineffective and mediaeval. Credit rating agency Moody’s said the shutdown would cause minimal U.S. economic and credit market disruption but there could be a more severe impact on financial market and the broad economy if the closure is protracted.',\n",
       " 'China ha warned the country’s pork industry that covering up case of African swine fever is a crime, day after a dead pig wa found on a Taiwanese beach prompting Taipei to claim Beijing wa not sharing accurate information on the disease. China’s animal husbandry and veterinary affair bureau is stepping up investigation and punishment of illegal activity in the pig industry, said a statement published on the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs website on Friday. Failing to report death and privately slaughtering and selling sick or dead pig would be pursued under criminal law, it said, and compensation of 1,200 yuan (138.45 pounds) for each pig culled wa sufficient incentive for farmer to report the disease. In the worst epidemic of the disease ever seen, China ha confirmed about 100 case of African swine fever across 23 province since August last year. The disease, for which there is neither cure nor vaccine, is deadly to pig but doe not harm people. But many expert believe it is even worse than ha been reported, and Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen urged Beijing last month to “not conceal” information about the disease. Tsai raised the issue again in a New Year’s speech after a dead pig wa found on a beach on Taiwan’s Kinmen island, a half-hour ferry ride from the east coast of China. The pig ha since been confirmed to have the African swine fever virus, while another dead pig wa found on a nearby island on Friday, Taiwan’s official Central News Agency reported. “During our recent effort to prevent an African swine fever epidemic, China’s government ha never followed the relevant agreement and provided Taiwan with accurate, real-time report about the epidemic situation,” she said. China ha repeatedly said that the disease ha been effectively dealt with and is under control. The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs did not immediately respond to a fax seeking comment on Friday. The dead animal found on the Taiwanese island have stoked fear that Taiwan’s pig could soon become infected with the disease. Taiwan’s herd of 5.39 million pig is tiny compared with China’s 700 million, but pork is the most popular meat in both place and domestic production in Taiwan reduces it need for import of the staple meat.

       " 'Ecuador’s President Lenin Moreno on Thursday asked the country’s prosecutor to probe $4.9 billion (3.9 billion pounds) of oil-related infrastructure projects, alleging that the OPEC nation’s money wa looted during the decade-long tenure of his leftist predecessor. Moreno said there were massive cost overruns, operational failing and non-transparent bidding process at the five project built during Rafael Correa’s presidency, including a $2.2 billion upgrade to the Esmeraldas refinery. “Nearly $5 billion of Ecuadoreans’ money, when it should have cost half that,” Moreno said in a national broadcast. “This theft of public fund cannot go unpunished.” Moreno took office in May 2017 after earning Correa’s endorsement during the campaign, but the two later fell out over Moreno’s market-friendly policies. Last year, Moreno asked a United Nations unit to conduct a technical and economic review of the five project undertaken by the previous administration. Correa ha denied allegation of corruption in his administration, calling them a political smear campaign. He life in Belgium and ha not returned to Ecuador since a judge last year ordered that he be jailed a part of a case involving the kidnapping of a lawmaker, in which he denies involvement. The other project Moreno mentioned included a natural gas liquefaction plant, a seaport, a fuel distribution centre, a pipeline and a partly-built refinery that ha run out of financing after receiving some $1.5 billion in investment.',\n",
       " 'President Donald Trump’s pick to serve a U.S. attorney general, William Barr, got his nomination off to an awkward start by telling lawmaker he did not register for the military draft during the Vietnam War, before saying on Thursday that he had in fact signed up. Barr, who previously served a attorney general under President George H. W. Bush, told the Senate Judiciary Committee he had incorrectly described his draft record in biographical material he submitted ahead of his confirmation hearings. “I have not served in the U.S. Military. I wa born in 1950 and wa not required to register for selective service,” he wrote on a questionnaire released by the committee. Historians said Barr would have been required to register for possible military service when he turned 18, a time when the government wa drafting roughly 300,000 people per year to serve in Vietnam. Barr changed his position after being asked by Reuters why he had not registered. “I registered for the selective service at 18, a required, and wa subject to the draft,” Barr wrote on Thursday in a letter to Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, the new chairman of the committee, and Senator Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat. Men who do not register for the draft face fine of up to $250,000 and a prison term of up to five years. They also are barred from most federal jobs, according to the Selective Service System, which register men for possible compulsory service. “I can’t imagine a scenario in which (Barr) would not have been required to register,” Kansas University history professor Beth Bailey said. Barr, 68, said he initially told lawmaker he had not registered because he is now too old for compulsory military service. He will have a chance to explain the mix-up when he appears before the Judiciary Committee for confirmation hearing on January 15 and 16. Many prominent U.S. politician — including Trump — have struggled to explain why they did not serve in the Vietnam War, which bitterly divided the United States. At Barr’s confirmation hearings, Democrats are expected to question him about his willingness to protect the independence of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into possible tie between Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and Russia. Barr criticized Mueller’s conduct of the probe in a lengthy memo submitted to the Justice Department last year, prompting Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer last month to call on Trump to find a new nominee for attorney general. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said last month that Barr’s memo ha had no impact on Mueller’s investigation. The investigation ha secured more than 30 indictment and guilty pleas, and ha spawned at least four federal probes. Trump ha repeatedly criticized it a a “witch hunt.” If confirmed by the Senate, Barr would take over from Matthew Whitaker, who ha been serving in an acting capacity since Trump forced out Jeff Sessions in November. Whitaker had been Sessions’ chief of staff.',\n",
       " 'In just over a decade, South Korea ha spent the equivalent of a small European economy trying to fix it demographic crisis, yet birthrate have dropped to the lowest in the world. This year, President Moon Jae-In, who describes himself a a feminist president, is testing a new angle: showing woman more respect. At the end of last year, South Korea announced plan to remove some of the disincentive for employing women, allowing both parent to take parental leave at the same time and extending paid paternal leave. Employers also get incentive to allow either parent to work fewer hours. “Efforts on gender equality are very timely,” said Shin Eun-kyung, an economist with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. South Korea is the worst place for woman to work in the OECD, despite woman being among the organisation’s best educated, and more highly so than men. But the measure go beyond the workplace: mother can choose to give the baby their own last name and a tickbox on birth certificate showing whether a baby wa born outside marriage will be removed. Fertility treatment will be offered to single woman and unmarried couple a well. Social campaign will encourage men to participate more in child care and household chores. Contrast that with a 2016 effort by the previous government, run by the country’s first woman president, Park Geun-hye, which launched a website carrying a real-time statistical heatmap of woman of child-bearing age, marriage and birth in the hope of spurring competition between city and regions. The website wa taken down after one day, with woman complaining it made them feel like “reproductive organs”. “The country see woman a baby factories,” say Hong Sook-young, who produce the country’s most popular child TV show. Asked about the latest measures, Hong said “at least pretending to hear what people really want is a start towards change”. For a graphic on South Korea birth rate versus the world, see - tmsnrt.rs/2RfZDEo South Korea’s demographic time bomb is ticking louder. The government’s latest forecast see it population declining from 2027, and a presidential committee said the country’s economic growth potential could fall to below 1 percent. Birth rate have long been a policy priority: since 2006, the government ha spent 152.9 trillion won (107.4 billion pounds) - about the size of an economy like Hungary or Nevada - on perk for family and subsidy for child from birth through university and beyond. Last year’s 26.3 trillion low birth policy budget wa more than half the defence spending of a country technically still at war with it northern neighbour. But demographic expert say money is not the main issue: the experience of advanced country with higher birth rates, such a France or Sweden, show gender equality play a crucial role. The previous allocation of resource drew criticism a well. The government went far beyond child allowance and subsidizing care and education. For instance, it funded temple stay for family bonding and financed youth seeking brief job abroad. Many such program will end, with the 2019 birth-support budget cut by a quarter, to 20.5 trillion won. “It should have been cut a long time ago,” said Jung Jae-hoon, social welfare professor at Seoul Women’s University. Jung cautioned, however, the signal the government wa finally sending will take a long time to filter through the conservative east Asian society. Births outside marriage, for instance, are so widely frowned upon that they amount to only 1.9 percent of the total, the lowest anywhere. Experts compare that to France, where the ratio is over 50 percent and the birth rate is 1.9 versus South Korea’s 1.05. Abortion is illegal and adoption rule very strict. The stigma of out-of-wedlock baby ha seen Seoul’s Jusarang Community Church build an oven-sized “baby box”, with cushion and a heating system into it outside wall. Last year, 261 child were abandoned across the country, according to Statistics Korea. About 56 percent of woman aged 15-64 work in South Korea, below the OECD average of almost 60 percent, and 72-75 percent in Denmark and Sweden, where birth rate are among the highest of advanced economies. Recruiters say married young woman are le likely to get job opportunity due to discrimination. In November, the Supreme Court upheld a four-year jail sentence against a former CEO of state-run Korea Gas Safety Corp over manipulating interview score to knock woman out of the hiring process. While Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) ha a more balanced gender ratio than Apple APPL.O globally, with woman accounting for 45 percent of the staff versus a third at it U.S. rival, only one in four staff at it Korea headquarters are women. None of the nine board member at Hyundai Motor Co (005380.KS) are women, versus six out of 12 at General Motors (GM.N). “The whole period of before, during and after childbirth weighs on our career,” said a female assistant manager at Hyundai Motor. The pay gap between sex only make it harder, she added. South Korea’s gender wage gap is highest among advanced country at 34.6 percent, above OECD average of 13.8 percent. A Hyundai Motor spokeswoman said the firm wa committed to providing equal opportunity to all employee and opposes discrimination. A Samsung Electronics spokeswoman said the company ha been recruiting more females, including in managerial positions, and that most staff return to work after parental leave and it day care centre can look after 3,000 children. Still, critic say while Moon’s approach to birth rate is an improvement, his job and housing policy discourage parenthood. Minimum wage hike have led to higher unemployment, while larger downpayment requirement have made home unaffordable for many. “Creating a structure that enables u to have our own house is mostly needed,” said Lee Kyoung-min, a store manager at Lotte Mart, a father of three. Some also argue work-life balance could be better: Moon in July cut the working week to 52 hour from 68, but South Koreans still work 15 percent longer than the OECD average. If birth rate don’t improve, South Korea’s economy could be 5 percent smaller by 2060, a productivity fall and higher spending for elderly care leaf le room for investment, the National Assembly Budget Office estimates. Industries catering for baby are struggling. Seoul ha lost one in four maternity ward and in 2018 the capital sacked more than half it teachers. Ryu Won-woo, manager of baby fair organizer BeFe, praised the government’s measures, especially those encouraging more responsibility for dads. But he doe not expect quick results. “More local baby-product company may disappear before Korea see more babies,” Ryu said.',\n",

A police spokesman said the driver had been detained and national broadcaster NHK said the man had been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. He wa identified a Kazuhiro Kusakabe, 21, from Osaka, a major city about 400 km (250 miles) southwest of Tokyo, NHK said. NHK said the suspect had initially described the incident a an “act of terror” but later said the attack wa in retaliation for capital punishment. The incident happened shortly after midnight local time on Monday in the popular tourist area of Harajuku, near Meiji Shrine, in central Tokyo. “I can’t believe it, this is a place I’m familiar with, so it’s very shocking,” said Tatsuhiro Yaegashi, a 27-year-old worker in the area. The street wa closed to vehicle at the time of the incident to accommodate the large number of pedestrian making their way to the shrine for New Year’s prayers.

       " 'A North Korean diplomat who wa until recently acting ambassador to Italy ha gone missing, a South Korean member of parliament said on Thursday, after a South Korean newspaper reported he wa seeking asylum in the West. The diplomat, 48-year-old Jo Song Gil, disappeared with his wife after leaving the embassy without notice in early November, according to Kim Min-ki, a South Korean lawmaker who wa briefed by the National Intelligence Service. Earlier on Thursday, the JoongAng Ilbo newspaper, citing an unidentified diplomatic source, said Jo had applied for asylum to an unspecified Western country and wa in a “safe place” with his family under the protection of the Italian government. A senior diplomatic source in Rome said Italy’s foreign ministry knew nothing about the reports. A second diplomatic source said the ministry had no record of Jo seeking asylum in Italy. The source added that North Korea had announced in late 2018 that it wa sending a new envoy to Rome. “It wa a perfectly normal procedure,” the source said. Kim told reporter he had some information about the case but could not discus it. “They left the diplomatic mission and vanished,” Kim said, referring to Jo and his family. If confirmed, Jo would join a slowly growing list of senior diplomat who have sought to flee the impoverished, oppressive North under the rule of Kim Jong Un. In August 2016 Thae Yong Ho, the North’s then deputy ambassador to Britain, defected with his family to South Korea, becoming the highest-ranking diplomat to do so. Thae said on Thursday Jo, whose father wa a diplomat, came from wealthy family, reported South Korean cable news Channel A. Although Jo’s father died early, Thae worked with his father-in-law, Ri To Sop, who wa also a diplomat at the foreign ministry. Ri wa in charge of protocol for event attended by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s father and grandfather. Jo lived in the “nicest apartment” in Pyongyang and his wife also graduated from a medical school in the capital, Thae said. The last time Thae saw Jo, before he wa stationed in Britain in 2013, he had one child and he understands he brought that child with him when he wa dispatched to Italy. He added Jo studied in Italy from 2006 to 2009 and it wa highly possible he wa involved in smuggling luxury good for the North Korean elite, a key task for diplomat there. Jo took up the acting envoy post in October 2017 after Italy expelled then-ambassador Mun Jong Nam in protest over North Korea’s nuclear and long-range missile test in defiance of U.N. Security Council sanctions. Jo’s stint began in May 2015 and wa due at the end of November, lawmaker Kim said. A source familiar with the matter, who asked to remain unnamed in order to speak about a sensitive political issue, told Reuters that Jo wa officially replaced a acting ambassador by Kim Chon in late November. The source could not confirm the JoongAng Ilbo report or whether Jo wa still based in Italy. South Korea’s presidential Blue House said earlier on Thursday it had no knowledge of the matter. Italy said in a report it submitted to a U.N. panel monitoring the enforcement of sanction in November 2017 that four diplomat were stationed at the North Korean embassy there, listing the acting envoy a first secretary. The JoongAng Ilbo said Jo wa with his wife and children. Citing an unidentified expert, it said he wa known to be the son or son-in-law of a top-ranking North Korean official. North Korea forced diplomat stationed overseas to leave child at home after Kim took power in late 2011. Thae, the former deputy ambassador to Britain, said in his 2018 memoir that wa the main reason behind his defection, calling it a “hostage” scheme. However, Thae also wrote there were some exception for those from the top echelon and who were seen a the most loyal to Kim.',\n",
       " 'Brazil’s new President Jair Bolsonaro said on Thursday that he would be open to the possibility of the United States operating a military base on his country’s soil, a move that would form a sharp shift in direction for Brazilian foreign policy. Bolsonaro, who took power on Tuesday, said that Russia’s support of President Nicolas Maduro’s “dictatorship” in neighbouring Venezuela had significantly ramped up tension in the region and wa a worrying development. Asked by the SBT TV network in an interview taped on Thursday if that meant he would allow U.S. military presence in Brazil, Bolsonaro responded that he would certainly be willing to negotiate that possibility. “Depending on what happens in the world, who know if we would not need to discus that question in the future,” Bolsonaro said. He emphasized that what Brazil seek is to have “supremacy here in South America.” The far-right leader is upending foreign policy dating back over a decade, which saw the leftist Workers Party emphasizing South-South relation and sometimes tussling on the international stage with the United States. Bolsonaro, a 63-year-old former Army captain and admirer of both Brazil’s 1964 to 1985 military dictatorship and U.S. President Donald Trump, ha quickly deepened tie with the Unites States and Israel. Bolsonaro’s national security adviser, retired Army General Augusto Heleno, confirmed earlier on Thursday that the president want to move Brazil’s embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, but that logistical consideration were standing in the way. Heleno did not elaborate. But the country’s powerful agriculture sector is opposed to moving the embassy from Tel Aviv and angering Arab nation that buy billion of dollar worth of Brazilian halal or “permissible” meat each year. Benjamin Netanyahu became the first Israeli Prime Minister to visit Brazil this week when he attended Bolsonaro’s inauguration. After a private meeting, Netanyahu said that Bolsonaro told him that moving the embassy wa a matter of “when, not if.” Heleno said on Thursday, “there is a clear desire that this happens, but there ha been no decision on a date.” He said he did not think export would be threatened, arguing that Brazilian diplomat would work with Middle Eastern trading partner to ease concerns. Bolsonaro and some state governor in Brazil are looking to purchase drone and lean on the United States and Israel for other technology and know-how a they seek to dismantle powerful and heavily armed drug cartels. Separately, Bolsonaro met with the head of the World Trade Organisation, Roberto Azevedo, who said the government’s sharp rebuke of globalism were shared by many other country and that the trade body wa making changes. On Wednesday, Brazil’s new Foreign Minister Ernesto Araujo said that under his watch the country would fight for change at multilateral institution like the WTO. Araujo’s word were not a threat, Azevedo said. “To the contrary, I think it wa very propitious and compatible with what is happening,” he said after meeting Bolsonaro. “The World Trade Organisation itself is beginning the process of reforms.” On the domestic front, Onyx Lorenzoni, Bolsonaro’s chief of staff, said after a first full meeting of the cabinet that the new administration wa committed to an ambitious pension overhaul, and that a privatisation programme wa still under evaluation. By early next week each minister should announce their top priority, Lorenzoni said. Bolsonaro’s economic team ha promised to liberalize Brazil’s hidebound economy, rid the country of “socialism,” and enact conservative social measure in area like education. On Wednesday, Bolsonaro unveiled plan to step up privatisations, toughen prison sentencing guideline and hand control over indigenous land claim to the powerful Agriculture Ministry. Brazilian market soared on promise to shrink government. Bolsonaro’s administration is made up of free market economists, statist former military generals, and religious ideologues, and it remains to be seen just how committed he is to liberalizing the economy. Nonetheless, Bolsonaro tweeted on Thursday morning that privatisation of 12 Brazilian airport and four port should attract 7 billion reais (1.48 billion pounds) in initial investment. He did not give further details.',\n",
       " 'Clashes among rival Syrian rebel faction have spread across northwest Syria, rebel and resident said on Thursday, in the latest bout of tit-for-tat fighting between opponent of President Bashar al Assad’s rule. Infighting ha long plagued Syria’s armed opposition since the uprising against Assad began in 2011. Turf war have helped the Syrian president, with his Iranian and Russian allies, recover much of the territory previously held by rebels. Tahrir al Sham, formerly affiliated to al Qaeda, had launched an attack on Tuesday against town in the western countryside of Aleppo held by Nour al Din Zinki, a member of the mainstream National Liberation Front (NLF), the rebel and resident told Reuters by telephone. The Islamist group, which on Wednesday seized the town of Darat Izza, said it wa retaliating for an ambush this week that killed five of it fighters. It blamed Nour al Din Zinki. Ideological difference divide hardline Islamist militant from nationalist group in the Free Syrian Army that have gathered under the banner of the NLF, which ha the backing of Syria’s neighbour Turkey. A rebel source said capturing the town of Darat Izza would strengthen the Islamist group in secret talk with Turkey, which ha a military foothold in the northern region and want to tighten it grip on the area to secure it border. The militant Islamists’ goal wa to create a contiguous stretch of territory from area they control north of Idlib near the Turkish border to stronghold in the Aleppo countryside, said a senior Western diplomat closely following Syria who requested anonymity. In a further bout of tit-for-tat fighting, NLF force who sent more deployment and announced a call for war, attacked Tahrir al Sham stronghold and checkpoint in Idlib province, resident and rebel said. “We hold Tahrir al Sham responsible for the dangerous and catastrophic repercussion that result from it escalation and call on it wise men to stop the fighting and preserve what is left of the revolution,” the NLF said in statement. Residents say the NLF ha made little progress in dislodging the Islamists from Saraqeb, one of the main city they hold in Idlib province. Fears however grew that fighting that ha mostly avoided civilian area could spill over into heavily populated urban areas. Dozens have so far been killed and wounded, rebel said. Although the Islamists are outnumbered by the mainstream NLF, they are the most powerful group in Idlib and have de facto control over most of the province, the last big rebel enclave. Scores of civilian in Maarat al Numan, an NLF-controlled town, held a rally against Tahrir al Sham on Wednesday, accusing the group and it leader Sheikh Abu Mohammad al Golani of serving Assad by launching it latest attack. Clashes between rebel faction have extended to Atma, a town on Idlib province’s northern border with Turkey. The town is now home to ten of thousand of Syrians displaced by the year of conflict and who now live in makeshift tents. One resident in the camp, Abdul Aziz Younis, told Reuters several civilian were killed when rebel shelled each other a hundred of family fled to safer places.',\n",
       " 'Survivors and lawyer demanded on Thursday the Catholic Church make public the name of 500 priest or clergy member in Illinois accused of child sexual abuse, in the latest outcry of a global crisis. They spoke out two week after Illinois state Attorney General Lisa Madigan issued a blistering report stating alleged abuser had not been publicly identified by the Church and many had not been properly investigated. “We’re here to fight for the 500 that have been identified a the number of clergy offender who the Catholic bishop ... in Illinois know about who have not disclosed,” attorney Jeff Anderson said at a news conference standing alongside survivors. Anderson said he and his colleague will issue a report by next month that identifies every clergy offender accused of child sexual abuse who wa brought to their attention. Children cannot be protected unless the name are provided to police and the general public, Anderson said. Knowing the name of the accused priest would also help victim who have not come forward, survivor Ken Kaczmarz said. “If the priest that molested them is on a published list, those people that are currently suffering in silence will, I guarantee you, have the courage to seek help,” he said. The Illinois diocese of Rockford, Joliet and Belleville on Thursday stood by list published on their website of priest with substantiated allegation of sexual abuse of a minor and of clergy removed from ministry.

       " 'Guyana’s government will challenge in court a parliamentary no-confidence vote that toppled President David Granger’s ruling coalition amid a dispute over developing the country’s nascent oil industry, the country’s attorney general said on Thursday. The Dec. 21 vote triggered new election within 90 days, after one lawmaker from Granger’s APNU-AFC coalition sided with the opposition, which accuses the government of mismanaging the country’s oil resource by granting Exxon Mobil overly generous contract terms. The government plan to argue that the motion needed 34 vote to pass, rather than the 33 it received, and that the lawmaker who cast the deciding vote wa ineligible to be a member of parliament because he also hold Canadian citizenship, attorney general Basil Williams said. Williams told reporter that the government would first petition the South American country’s High Court, and if unsuccessful is prepared to appeal to Guyana’s Court of Appeal and the Caribbean Court of Justice (CCJ), the judicial body of the Caricom group of nations. “We’re off to the CCJ,” Williams said. Guyana ha no history of crude production but ha in recent year become one of the world’s most closely watched basin after Exxon Mobil discovered more than 5 billion barrel of oil and gas offshore. Commercial production is expected to begin in 2020, and output could reach 750,000 barrel per day. The day after the no-confidence vote, the navy of neighbouring Venezuela halted two boat hired by Exxon to conduct a seismic survey in the western portion of the Stabroek block. Both country say the incident occurred in their territorial waters, reigniting a century-long border dispute. Granger, who returned to Guyana this week after undergoing chemotherapy in Cuba, plan to meet with opposition leader Bharrat Jagdeo of the People’s Progressive Party next week. Jagdeo ha said Granger “sold our patrimony” to Exxon Mobil. The government ha insisted that it got the best deal it could and is banking on new oil wealth to transform the economy of the English-speaking country of just 750,000.',\n",

Chinese state medium were more reserved, saying Xi hoped the negotiating team could meet each other halfway and reach an agreement that wa mutually beneficial. The rise in U.S. equity mirrored that in Asian and European markets, which were also buoyed by trade optimism. Despite Monday’s advance, equity ended the year largely in the red, victim of investor anxiety over trade tension and slowing economic growth. Asian and European share had been sluggish for much of the year, and in recent months, U.S. stock followed suit. “If the European economy continues to decelerate and the Chinese economy decelerates because of tariffs, there is definitely going to be spillover to the United States,” said Shannon Saccocia, chief investment officer at Boston Private. The S&P 500 dropped more than 9 percent in December, it largest decline since the Great Depression. For the year, the index slid more than 6 percent, it biggest drop since the 2008 financial crisis.

The victory consolidates Hasina’s decade-long rule in the South Asian nation, in which her government ha overseen booming economic growth, but is accused of human right abuse and suppressing dissent - charge her government denies. In a victory speech at her official residence in the capital Dhaka, Hasina, 71, touted robust support for her Awami League-led alliance, which won 287 of the 298 seats, while the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)-led alliance got six seats. “They voted so enthusiastically,” Hasina told a room full of journalist and foreign election observers. “What do people want? They want to fulfil their basic needs. When they feel that yes, only this government can ensure it, then definitely they will vote for us.” The opposition rejected the result and called for a fresh vote, complaining of what it said wa widespread rigging. Neighbours India and China congratulated Hasina, and a visiting election monitoring group from South Asian country said they had found nothing amiss in voting in the capital Dhaka. There wa no immediate statement from the European Union or the United States, which had expressed concern last week over campaign violence it said had mostly impacted opposition candidates, and a delay in visa for many U.S.-funded observer who couldn’t make it into the country. At least 17 people were killed during Sunday’s poll that followed a violent election campaign in which both side blamed the other for casualties. Candidates reported witnessing ballot-stuffing and vote-rigging by ruling party activists, who also barred opposition polling agent from voting centres, said opposition leader Kamal Hossain. “We’ve had bad election in the past but I must say that it is unprecedented how bad this particular election was,” Hossain said. Bangladesh’s Election Commission said it wa investigating allegation of vote rigging but rejected demand for another vote. Human Rights Watch expressed concern over the election’s credibility and Amnesty International called for an impartial probe into “deeply disturbing” election violence. “ONE-PARTY STATE” The opposition BNP alleged it wa never granted a level playing field to campaign in the election, with thousand of it worker locked up on charge it termed a fictitious, and many candidate attacked by ruling party activists, crippling it campaign. The BNP had boycotted the last poll in 2014, not trusting Hasina to hold them fairly, and some BNP leader said Sunday’s vote had proved them right. The BNP went to the vote for the first time without it leader Khaleda Zia – Hasina’s arch rival and a former prime minister – who wa jailed in February on corruption charge she say were politically motivated. The rivalry between the two woman ha largely defined Bangladeshi politics for decades. Hasina on Sunday referred to the BNP a “terrorists”, saying the election had been “very peaceful” barring a few incident in which worker for her party were killed. She said the Election Commission wa independent and would investigate any allegation of rigging. Hasina, the longest-serving leader in the history of the Muslim-majority country of 165 million people, promised more development and an improved economy in her third straight term. Her adviser H.T. Imam said the government would consider raising the minimum wage for worker in it garment industry, which generates about 83 percent of export and is the world’s second-largest only after China’s. “Certainly, the Awami League enjoys strong constituency and ha support and it can get votes, but for any party to win more than 90 percent of the seat is simply too suspicious,” said Michael Kugelman, South Asia senior associate at the Washington-based Wilson Centre think-tank. “I fear that this election result signifies that Bangladesh ha really become something very closely approximating a one-party state.”',\n",

Pompeo said Iran planned to launch in the coming month three rockets, called Space Launch Vehicles (SLV), that he said incorporate technology “virtually identical” to what is used in intercontinental ballistic missiles. “The United States will not stand by and watch the Iranian regime’s destructive policy place international stability and security at risk,” Pompeo said in a statement. “We advise the regime to reconsider these provocative launch and cease all activity related to ballistic missile in order to avoid deeper economic and diplomatic isolation.” Pompeo said the rocket launch would violate U.N.

It call upon Iran not to undertake activity related to ballistic missile capable of delivering nuclear weapons, but doe not explicitly bar such activity.

The FSB opened a criminal case against Whelan but gave no detail of his alleged espionage activities. Interfax said the Russian authority had brought formal charge against Whelan on Thursday, citing what it described a an informed source. Reuters could not independently verify the Interfax report.

       " 'Pope Francis accused U.S. bishop on Thursday of failing to show unity in the face of a sexual abuse crisis, saying internal bickering had to end over a scandal that ha shredded the Church’s credibility. In a long and highly unusual letter sent to U.S. bishop a they embarked on a week-long retreat, Francis said the handling of the scandal showed the urgent need for a new approach to management and mindset within the Roman Catholic Church. “God’s faithful people and the Church’s mission continue to suffer greatly a a result of abuse of power and conscience and sexual abuse, and the poor way that they were handled,” the pope wrote, adding that bishop had “concentrated more on pointing finger than on seeking path of reconciliation”. Pope Francis ha summoned the head of some 110 national Catholic bishops’ conference and dozen of expert and leader of religious order to the Vatican on Feb. 21-24 for an extraordinary gathering dedicated to the now global crisis. Victims of clergy sexual abuse are hoping that the meeting will finally come up with a clear policy to make bishop themselves accountable for the mishandling of abuse cases. Ahead of that encounter, U.S. bishop gathered on Wednesday near Chicago for seven day of prayer and spiritual reflection. “The Church’s credibility ha been seriously undercut and diminished by these sin and crimes, but even more by the effort made to deny or conceal them,” Francis said. The pope said he wa so concerned by the situation that he had hoped to attend the retreat in person, but added that he had been unable to do so “for logistical reasons”. However, he sent his own preacher, Raniero Cantalamessa, to lead proceedings. The U.S. Church is still reeling from a grand jury report last year that found that 301 priest in the state of Pennsylvania had sexually abused minor over a 70-year period. Other U.S. state have launched investigation of their own. “The hurt caused by these sin and crime ha also deeply affected the communion of bishops, and generated not the sort of healthy and necessary disagreement and tension found in any living body, but rather division and dispersion,” the pope said. Critics accuse Francis, who became pontiff in 2013, of responding much too slowly to the sex scandals, of failing to empathise with the victim and of blindly believing the word of his fellow clergy. But in 2018 he tried to address past wrongs, publicly admitting he wa wrong about a case in Chile and vowing that the Church would never again seek to cover up such wrongdoing. In July, he accepted the resignation of Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, one of the U.S. Church’s most prominent figures, following allegation he had sexually abused a 16-year-old boy, while in October, Cardinal Donald Wuerl, the archbishop of Washington D.C., stepped down over his handling of abuse cases. “Combatting the culture of abuse, the loss of credibility, the resulting bewilderment and confusion, and the discrediting of our mission urgently demand of u a renewed and decisive approach to resolving conflicts,” the pope wrote on Thursday. “This requires not only a new approach to management, but also a change in our mindset.”',\n",

It wa unclear how many of the container sank to the sea bottom and how many were still floating and could pose a hazard to marine traffic or beach scavenger who turned out in response to report of the cargo spill. A 25-kg (55-pound) bag of organic peroxide, a strong bleaching agent that can cause injury on contact with skin, wa swept ashore on Thursday, among dozen of container from the ship to have appeared on or near the Dutch island of Terschelling, Vlieland, Ameland and Schiermonnikoog. “The expectation is that more thing may wash up on beach tonight,” Defence Ministry spokesman Sjaak Van Elten said. At least three of the container were thought to contain hazardous chemicals. Dutch soldier were summoned to help clean up the mess. Emergency service warned volunteer not to touch the containers, but scavenger and treasure-hunters also flocked to the jetsam, which included shoes, doll and flat-screen TVs. The peroxide wa removed by emergency crew without incident, Friesland provincial authority said. But the Dutch Coast Guard said attempt to locate floating container were being “hindered by multiple sport plane that have come to look ... We ask them to remain out of the area of this air space to prevent dangerous situations”. German authority are leading the investigation into what caused the accident, which occurred in German water near the island of Borkum. An MSC statement said the container were lost overboard during “heavy weather”, and a salvage company had been hired to assist in the cleanup and search for missing items. MSC said it wa taking the incident “very seriously, both in term of the impact of such accident on the natural environment and in term of any damage to customers’ cargo”.

Containers broke open on the shore of the Dutch island of Terschelling and Vlieland. Others were floating or stranded off the coast of Ameland and Schiermonnikoog, part of a chain of island that guard the Dutch coast. The Coast Guard warned ship in the area to beware of floating containers. Three container holding hazardous material have not yet been located, the Coast Guard said. Dutch medium reported that local treasure hunter had found an array of item from container whose content had spilled, including light bulbs, car parts, Ikea furniture, clothing and toys. Local medium carried picture of group of people congregating around beached blue container and one carrying off what appeared to be a flatscreen TV still packed in foam. Such material is considered flotsam, and resident of the island have a centuries-old tradition of collecting it. It wa unclear if the good were water-damaged. The mayor of the island of Vlieland, Tineke Schokker, said that the municipality doesn’t mind scavenging. “It’s just really nice of people,” she told local news agency ANP. “Processing it would cost more than the stuff is worth, and anyway with the two officer we have it would be impossible to guard, the stuff is littered over the whole beach.” A spokesman for the ship’s operator, MSC, had no immediate comment.',\n",

Nicholas Haysom briefed the U.N. Security Council in New York but did not address a statement issued by Somalia’s foreign affair ministry late on Tuesday that accused him of interfering in internal affair and said he “cannot work in this country.” Haysom had raised question in a letter on Sunday about the involvement of U.N.-supported Somali security force in the arrest of a former militant of the Islamist al Shabaab group who wa blocked from running in a recent regional election. He told the 15-member Security Council that the allegation of interference by the federal government in the regional election and the violence that followed the former militant’s arrest “does not bode well for the upcoming electoral process in other region or for the 2020 national elections.” “This may also have implication for the likelihood of future al Shabaab defector who may be considering exchanging violence for a political path,” said Haysom, a South African. Somalia showed no sign on Thursday of backing down from it decision to effectively make Haysom persona non grata. The United Nations said on Wednesday it wa looking into the matter and that Haysom would meet with U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Thursday. The United Nations is a major backer of Somalia, a country that ha lacked strong central government since 1991. The government’s decision on Haysom could intensify a confrontation between Mogadishu and the semiautonomous regions. Somalia’s U.N. Ambassador Abukar Dahir Osman told the Security Council on Thursday that the Somali people wanted “Somalia leading international support, not international support leading Somalia.” “Somalia distinguishes between the institution that we are part of and individual conduct that’s had detrimental effect on our fragile nation,” he said. “We reject the criticism and attempt to re-brand renewed terrorist a an ice cream salesperson without redeeming themselves.” Al Shabaab ha sought for over a decade to topple the central government and implement it strict version of Islamic law.

Most bus service were halted and taxi were refusing to take passenger a some driver said they feared they would be attacked. Some protester burst makeshift bomb outside a police station in the state capital of Thiruvananthapuram, police said. On Thursday morning, about 400 protester - including some woman - marched towards the main city junction in Kochi, the commercial capital of Kerala, to stage a sit-in, shouting slogan and waving flags, with street otherwise deserted. They were backed by official from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the ideological parent of the BJP. India’s Supreme Court in September ordered the lifting of the ban on woman of menstruating age entering the Sabarimala hill temple, which draw million of worshipper a year. The temple ha refused to abide by the ruling and subsequent attempt by woman to visit have been blocked by thousand of devotees. On Wednesday, two woman were escorted by police into the temple through a side gate. They offered prayer from the top of a staircase where they could see the deity below without drawing the attention of the priest or other devotees, a police official familiar with the operation said. He did not wish to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue. The Kerala state government is run by left-wing party and ha sought to allow woman into the temple, a position that ha drawn criticism from both of India’s main political parties, the ruling BJP and the opposition Congress.

British lawmaker are due to decide later this month whether to accept Prime Minister Theresa May’s plan for a managed exit and relatively close economic ties, or reject the deal and spawn uncertainty about the country’s next steps. Before the vote, May is seeking last-minute reassurance from the European Union over the Irish backstop - an insurance policy to avoid a hard border between the British province and EU-member Ireland. “We want to be in a position to give guarantees, give assurances, give clarification (but) we need to know what the United Kingdom parliament wants,” Varadkar told journalist in Dublin. “But they need to also understand that there will be no explanation, guarantee or clarification that contradicts or render inoperable any part of the withdrawal agreement,” he said. Varadkar said he had a long “brainstorming” conversation with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Thursday in which the two leader agreed that Britain not the EU would need to come up with a proposal to overcome the impasse. Varadkar said he had “given up speculating” on whether Britain would leave the European Union without a deal. But he said his government wa now addressing preparation for such an outcome with the same seriousness a it wa addressing preparation for an exit under May’s deal. Varadkar’s advisor is due to speak to one of May’s advisor on Thursday he said.

       " 'Lawyers for Bijan Rafiekian, the ex-business partner of former U.S. national security adviser Michael Flynn, said Thursday they want to delay the upcoming February criminal trial into whether their client covertly lobbied for Turkey. During a hearing in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Rafiekian’s attorney Robert Trout said he need more time to review evidence turned over on Thursday morning, and plan to ask the judge to move the trial from February 11 to sometime in September. Rafiekian, a former U.S. Export-Import Bank director and co-founder of the consultancy firm Flynn Intel Group, is facing charge that he covertly lobbied for Turkey to discredit and extradite Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen from the United States to Turkey. He wa indicted in December along with Ekim Alptekin, a Turkish-Dutch businessman, for failing to disclose their lobbying and lying about the nature of their work. Rafiekian is facing two criminal counts, including acting a a foreign agent and conspiracy, while Alptekin is facing six. Rafiekian ha pleaded not guilty to the charges, and Alptekin ha previously denied the allegation through a spokesperson. Rafiekian’s indictment came about a year after Flynn wa charged by Special Counsel Robert Mueller for lying to the FBI about his contact with the former Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak. President Donald Trump fired Flynn in early 2017. As part of his plea deal, Flynn also admitted to lying about his role in the Turkish lobbying effort. The case against Rafiekian is being brought by prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney’s office in the Eastern District of Virginia, and not by Mueller’s office. However, prosecutor James Gillis told the judge on Thursday that much of the evidence turned over came from Mueller’s investigators. Last month, a federal judge in Washington fiercely criticized Flynn for lying to the FBI in connection with Mueller’s probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election and delayed his sentencing until he ha finished helping prosecutors. It is unclear whether or not Flynn could be called upon to testify in the case against Rafiekian. Trout said Thursday that a part of his plan to mount a defence, he may seek evidence abroad, including possibly deposing relevant witness overseas.

The problem in this small Central American country grabbed international attention a U.S. President Donald Trump cracked down on illegal immigration. Honduras ha for year been one of the world’s most murderous countries. Though official data show the homicide rate ha fallen sharply, it continues to be a highly challenging environment in which to work. According to Honduran government figures, the homicide rate reached 86 per 100,000 people in 2011-2012. This year, the rate should end below 40 per 100,000, the security ministry says.

       " 'The Tokyo District Court said on Monday it ha extended the detention of ousted Nissan Motor Co (7201.T) chairman Carlos Ghosn by 10 day until Jan. 11. Ghosn, accused of aggravated breach of trust, is facing allegation of making the car maker shoulder 1.85 billion yen (13.2 million pounds) in personal investment losses. The latest extension will see Ghosn remain in Tokyo’s main detention centre, where he ha been confined since his first arrest on Nov. 19 on allegation of financial misconduct. Since then, he ha been re-arrested twice over the latest allegation and on claim that he underreported his Nissan salary for a prolonged period. He denies the allegations. Calls to the office of Ghosn’s lawyer, Motonari Otsuru, were not answered on Monday, an unofficial holiday in Japan. A Nissan spokesman said the car maker wa not in a position to comment on the latest development in the case. “The company’s own investigation is ongoing, and it scope continues to broaden,” the spokesman said. The decision to extend Ghosn’s time in detention come a day before his 10-day detention period for the latest allegation wa set to expire on Tuesday, and follows the release of former Nissan executive Greg Kelly on bail last week after a court ruled against extending his detention while he awaits trial. Both Ghosn and Kelly were initially arrested in late November and have been charged with underreporting Ghosn’s salary at Nissan over a five-year period from 2010. Both deny the charges. Nissan’s board in November fired Ghosn a chairman and Kelly a representative director, although both men technically still remain board member who can only be removed by shareholders. Ghosn’s arrest ha rocked the auto industry and strained Nissan’s tie with French automaking partner Renault SA (RENA.PA), where Ghosn still remains chairman and CEO. Ghosn served a CEO of Nissan for more than a decade through 2017 and concurrently held the chairman position at Renault, Nissan and partner Mitsubishi Motors Corp (7211.T) until his arrest. The three automaker are linked by a complicated share-holding structure under which Renault hold a 43.4 percent stake in Nissan, and Nissan hold a 15 percent stake in Renault, with no voting rights. Nissan hold a 34 percent stake in Mitsubishi Motors. Since Ghosn’s arrest, Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa ha called for change to weaken the clout of controlling shareholder Renault. Ghosn’s arrest ha also put Japan’s criminal justice system under international scrutiny and sparked criticism for some of it practices, including keeping suspect in detention for long period and prohibiting defence lawyer from being present during interrogations, which can last eight hour a day.

       " 'The future of Kurdish-led area of northern and eastern Syria ha been thrown into doubt by President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw U.S. troop who have helped to secure the region. Amounting to about one quarter of Syria, the area is the largest chunk of territory still outside the control of President Bashar al-Assad, who is backed by Russia and Iran. Trump said on Wednesday the United States would withdraw slowly “over a period of time” and would protect the U.S.-backed Kurdish fighter a Washington withdraws troops, but without giving a timetable. Syrian Kurdish leader fear Turkey will use the withdrawal a an opportunity to launch an assault. As a result, they are in contact with Moscow and Damascus in the hope of agreeing arrangement to protect the region from Turkey while also aiming to safeguard their political gains. The main Syrian Kurdish faction, the Democratic Union Party (PYD), began to establish a foothold in the north early in the war a government force withdrew to put down the anti-Assad uprising elsewhere. An affiliated militia, the People’s Protection Units (YPG), secured the region. Early in the conflict, their control wa concentrated in three predominantly Kurdish region home to roughly 2 million Kurds. Kurdish-led governing body were set up. The area of YPG influence expanded a the YPG allied with the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State (IS), becoming the spearhead of a multi-ethnic militia, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). SDF influence widened to Manbij and Raqqa a IS wa defeated in both. It ha also reached deep into Deir al-Zor, where the SDF is still fighting IS. Kurdish leader say their aim is regional autonomy within a decentralised Syria, not independence. The PYD is heavily influenced by the idea of Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan, a founding member of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which ha waged a 34-year insurgency in Turkey for Kurdish political and cultural rights. Ocalan ha been in jail since 1999 in Turkey. He is convicted of treason. The PKK is designated a terrorist organization by Turkey, the United States and the European Union. Turkey say the PKK is indistinguishable from the PYD and YPG. Turkey ha a Kurdish minority equal to 15 to 20 percent of it population, mostly living in eastern and southeastern area bordering Syria. Wary of separatistism, Turkey view the PYD’s Syrian foothold a a national security threat. Syria’s main Kurdish group do not hide Ocalan’s influence: they organised election towards establishing a political system based on his ideas. Turkey ha already mounted two cross-border offensive in northern Syria a part of it effort to counter the YPG. Syria’s Baathist state systematically persecuted the Kurds before the war. Yet the YPG and Damascus have broadly stayed out of each other’s way during the conflict, despite occasional clashes. They also have been seen to cooperate against shared foes, notably in and around Aleppo. The YPG ha allowed the Syrian state to keep a foothold in it areas. The YPG commander told Reuters in 2017 it would have no problem with the Assad government if Kurdish right are guaranteed in Syria. But Damascus opposes Kurdish autonomy demands: the Syrian foreign minister last month said “nobody in Syria accepts talk about independent entity or federalism”. Talks between the side last year made no progress. The Kurdish-led authority are launching a new initiative aiming to put pressure on the government to reach a political settlement “within the framework of a decentralized Syria,” leading Kurdish politician Ilham Ahmed said last week. Analysts say the Kurds’ negotiating position ha been weakened by Trump’s announcement. WHAT WOULD AN ASSAD-KURD DEAL MEAN FOR THE WAR? The territory held by Damascus and the Kurdish-led authority account for most of Syria. A political settlement - if one could be reached, perhaps with Russian help - could go a long way to stitching the map back together. But it would not mark the end of the war. Anti-Assad insurgents, though defeated across much of Syria by the government and it allies, still have a foothold in the northwest stretching from Idlib through Afrin to Jarablus. Turkey ha troop on the ground in this area. The rebel include Turkey-backed Free Syrian Army group and jihadists. Enmity run deep between the YPG and these groups. For the YPG, one priority is recovering Afrin from the rebel who seized it in a Turkey-backed offensive last year. Assad also want Turkey out a he vow to recover “every inch” of Syria.

       " 'Germany’s Agriculture Minister want to loosen restriction on shooting wolf to reduce a growing population that threatens sheep and goats. Wolves disappeared from Germany a century ago after many were killed, in part because they are symbol of cunning and wickedness in German folklore but also because they attack farm animal and even humans. They have made a comeback across Germany and the ministry say more than 600 now roam a northern belt from the border with Poland and the Czech Republic to the Dutch frontier. Wolves killed more than 1,000 farm animal in 2016, said the ministry. Farmers say their animal are being ravaged and hunter say wolf eat game they want to shoot and even damage trees. But their legal protection is viewed a sacrosanct by animal welfare and biodiversity groups. The wolf population will likely rise by an annual 30 percent, the ministry said on it website. “This excellent success in term of specie protection is a challenge for those keeping grazing animals,” it said. Agriculture Minister Julia Kloecker wrote last month to her counterpart in the environment ministry, Svenja Schulze, to lobby for a change in the rule to allow more wolf to be shot a part of a moderate regulation of the wolf population. It wa unclear who would be licensed do to do the shooting. She said an earlier suggestion by Schulze to allow the removal of individual wolf that pose a danger wa a step in the right direction but wa insufficient. Wolf management is a political issue and there wa even a clause on the need to come up with a strategy on wolf in last year’s coalition deal between the conservative of Chancellor Angela Merkel and the Social Democrats. Currently, farmer can get compensation for farm animal that fall prey to wolf and subsidy for electric fence are available to help keep them out. The latest data from the Federal Office for the Protection of Nature show Germany ha 73 pack of wolves, 13 more than a year earlier, and for the first time, the southern state of Bavaria ha it own pack.

       " 'Short of time to save his sinking economy, Sudan’s President Omar al-Bashir boarded a Russian jet on Dec. 17 and became the first Arab leader to visit Damascus since 2011, renewing what ha been seen a a push for the financial help he need to survive. Events at home soon caught up with him. Two day later, demonstrator angered by bread price rise torched the ruling party headquarters in the city of Atbara, setting off two week of protest that quickly spread across the country, with crowd calling on Bashir to step down. The protest are the most sustained challenge to Bashir since he took power in an Islamist-backed coup nearly 30 year ago, more widespread and longer-lasting than bout of unrest in September 2013 and January 2018. They risk propelling Sudan deeper into crisis, upending Bashir’s attempt to stave off financial collapse and destabilising a country beset by simmering internal conflict that straddle Africa and the Middle East. “What we are witnessing today is the second and stronger wave of the protest that swept Sudan in September 2013. Frustration with the rising cost of living ha been building up and is now boiling over again,” said independent analyst Muhammad Osman. Officials have acknowledged 19 death in the demonstrations. Amnesty International said last week it had credible report that 37 protester had been shot dead. “Bashir and his inner circle will not go down without a fight,” said Osman. Bashir ha survived a one of the region’s longest serving leaders, riding out 20 year of U.S. sanction and shrugging off an indictment by the International Criminal Court on charge of crime against humanity and genocide in Darfur. The protest come a the 75-year-old ha been pushing to shore up his position economically a well a politically, lobbying to be removed from the list of countries, along with Syria, Iran and North Korea, that the U.S. considers state sponsor of terrorism. That listing ha prevented an influx of investment and financial aid that Sudan wa hoping for when the U.S. lifted sanction October 2017, according to economists. Instead, Sudan ha been rapidly expanding it money supply to finance it budget deficit, causing spiralling inflation officially recorded at nearly 70 percent and a steep decline in the value of it currency. During his trip to Damascus, Bashir wa courting the Russians by helping rehabilitate their ally Bashar al-Assad after Syria’s civil war in order to win financial support or play them off against the U.S., analyst said. Bashir ha also sought favour with Gulf state including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, cutting tie with Iran in 2016 and contributing troop to the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, even while maintaining close relation with two of their regional rivals, Qatar and Turkey. “The confusion in Sudanese foreign policy and the shift from one alliance to another is caused by the severe economic crisis in the country and President al-Bashir want to obtain quick economic aid,” said Faisal Mohamed Saleh, a journalist and political analyst in Khartoum. Those economic problems, at the root of discontent that ha simmered for years, accelerated after Sudan lost three-quarters of it oil production when the south of the country seceded in 2011. In the eye of protesters, the economic trouble are deeply entwined with corruption and mismanagement in the political elite and the ruling National Congress Party (NCP), said Amjed Farid Eltayeb, an activist and spokesman for the Sudan Change Now movement. “The NCP for the last 30 year have directed most of the national budget to the security apparatus, to the militias, and they cut all the funding of the social services, education, health,” he said. “So those people who are now in the street have no social protection nets, they are alone in a battle with fate ... they have nothing to lose.” Opposition party are emasculated, and the protest so far are leaderless, with demonstrator coalescing in individual town and neighbourhoods, and circumventing block on social medium to share information on the web. Chanting the line made famous in the Arab Spring protest of 2011 - “The people want the fall of the regime” - they have continued to rally despite security force using live ammunition, tear gas, and stun grenade to disperse them. With Sudan in it worst economic crisis since independence in 1956, Bashir risk the fate of other authoritarian ruler toppled eight year ago unless the NCP switch candidate ahead of election due next year, said Eltayeb Zine al-Abedine, a political science professor at the University of Khartoum. “The economic crisis and public discontent are lessening the chance of President Omar al-Bashir running for the 2020 elections,” he said. But Bashir show no sign of stepping aside. Members of Khartoum’s parliament, which is dominated by the NCP, proposed a constitutional amendment last month to extend term limit that would have required Bashir to step down in 2020. Since the demonstration began, Bashir ha appeared largely unperturbed, tempering his talk of conspiracy against Sudan with pledge of economic reform, call for restraint and the announcement of a fact-finding committee – step dismissed by protester a symbolic. “We are committed to holding free and fair election in 2020, and we ask that all political power prepare to participate,” Bashir said on Monday.

Just three month before the United Kingdom is due to leave the world’s largest bloc, the risk of a no-deal Brexit is rising — the nightmare scenario for many businesses, which are now planning for an economic shock. Extra ship will be needed to work new route across the Channel in the event that the main French terminal of Calais and Britain’s Dover and Folkestone are clogged up by custom checks. Currently, Britain’s membership of the EU mean that truck drive smoothly through border check within the bloc. But in a no-deal Brexit, even a few minutes’ delay at custom for each truck would be likely to mean vehicle backing up at port and queuing on feeder road on both side of the Channel. To ease a potential backlog, the government ha awarded three contract to provide additional freight capacity on route from English south-coast port including Poole, Portsmouth and Plymouth. They comprise one worth 47 million pound with the French firm Brittany Ferries, a 47 million pound deal with the Danish shipping company DFDS and a 14 million pound contract with Seaborne Freight. The leader of the opposition Liberal Democrat party, Vince Cable, called the move “complete madness” and said public money wa being spent recklessly in a last-minute bid to prepare for a no-deal outcome. The contract were not put out to tender. The Department for Transport said it wa responding to a “situation of extreme urgency” brought about by “unforeseeable events”. About 16,000 truck pas between Dover and Calais every day, transporting everything from perishable food to medicine and the industrial good needed to keep factory running. “This extra capacity is a small but important element of the DfT’s no-deal planning,” the Department for Transport said in a statement. “While remaining committed to working to ensure a deal is reached, the department is helping ensure the rest of government are fully prepared for a range of scenarios.” Earlier this month, the government announced that all government department must step up planning for a no-deal Brexit, including putting 3,500 armed force personnel on standby to deal with any disruption.

       " 'Saudi Arabian prosecutor is seeking the death penalty for five of the 11 suspect detained over the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, the state news agency SPA said on Thursday, a a Saudi court held a first hearing on the case. Saudi Arabia said it also sent new letter to the Turkish public prosecutor asking for “any evidence connected to this case”, which ha rattled the Saudi royal court and damaged the reputation of 33-year-old Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Khashoggi wa close to the royal circle before becoming a critic of Prince Mohammed, writing for the Washington Post and speaking to international medium about Saudi politics when he moved to the United States last year. Saudi official have rejected accusation that the crown prince ordered his murder in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, in which Khashoggi’s body wa dismembered, removed from the building and handed over to an unidentified “local cooperator”. The whereabouts of Khashoggi’s remains are still unknown. A Turkish television channel on Monday showed men carrying suitcase purportedly containing the remains into the residence of the Saudi consul general in Istanbul. “The initial hearing for the 11 individual indicted by the Public Prosecution in the case of the murder of citizen Jamal Khashoggi wa held today ... in the Criminal Court of Riyadh,” a statement from the Saudi prosecutor carried by SPA said. The prosecutor’s office said it wa seeking the death penalty for five individual among the 11 indicted. Ten other suspect were still under investigation. Without naming them, the prosecutor said last November the five individual facing by the death penalty were “charged with ordering and committing the crime”. SPA added that the defendants’ lawyer attended the hearing and the court approved a request from the 11 for more time to prepare their defence. It gave no detail on the next hearing. Saudi King Salman sacked Saud al-Qahtani, a former top aide to Prince Mohammed, Istanbul Consul General Mohammed Alotaibi and former deputy intelligence chief Ahmed al-Asiri in connection with Khashoggi’s murder.

Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan ha said Khashoggi’s killing wa ordered by the highest level of Saudi leadership. Thursday’s statement said the kingdom wa still awaiting response to request for information sent to Turkish officials. Last week, King Salman put Ibrahim al-Assaf, a veteran former finance minister, in charge of foreign affairs, in an effort to improve the kingdom’s image after the crisis caused by the killing. Assaf replaced Adel al-Jubeir, and expert in Saudi politics said the move reflected a perception that Jubeir wa tainted by having served a Riyadh’s chief global defender during the Khashoggi affair.

IRNA said on Thursday President Hassan Rouhani accepted the resignation of Hassan Ghazizadeh Hashemi, widely seen a the key official behind the 2014 launch of an ambitious plan for universal medical insurance sometimes dubbed “Rouhanicare”. Hashemi had repeatedly complained about delay in payment of budgeted fund in the past and about cut in his ministry’s budget under the new state spending plans, IRNA said. U.S. President Donald Trump reintroduced sanction on Iran last year, targeting in particular the country’s lifeblood oil sector, after pulling out of a 2015 nuclear deal. The move ha helped depress the value of Iran’s rial currency and aggravated annual inflation fourfold to nearly 40 percent in November. Last month, Rouhani presented a $47 billion draft state budget with increased spending on lower income groups, saying the U.S. sanction would affect people’s life and economic growth but not bring the government to it knees. Despite the rise in the rial value of the budget, however, it is effectively worth about half of the current budget because of the recent weakening of the currency and galloping inflation.

       " 'President Emmanuel Macron’s head of medium relation said on Thursday he would quit, a sign that a gruelling reform drive and a spate of political scandal and street protest are starting to wear down his inner circle a year and a half into his mandate. Sylvain Fort, who shaped Macron’s campaign messaging during his presidential campaign and penned some of the young leader’s most memorable speeches, will leave the Elysee palace for “personal reasons”, government minister said. “After two year and a half of relentless work serving the candidate and later our president, I wish to pursue other professional and personal projects, and above all dedicate more time to my family,” Fort told French news agency AFP. His resignation follows the departure of Macron’s political adviser late last year to lead the ruling party’s European parliament election campaign. Rumours are swirling in French medium of other close adviser who may head out the door. Privately, aide say the pace of reforms, Macron’s own hyperactivity, his frequent foreign trip and a relentless news cycle are taking their toll on even the most committed of his loyalists. Fort, an opera buff and literature graduate from the elite ENS school, preferred the more reclusive role of chief speechwriter after Macron’s election victory in May 2017. Macron persuaded Fort to return to a front-line medium relation role last summer after the violent conduct of Macron’s former bodyguard and the Elysee’s attempted cover-up of the matter sent his popularity into a nosedive and raised question about decision-making inside the president’s office. Surrounded by a small coterie of close aide dubbed the “Macron boys”, the 41-year-old pushed through a series of reform to liberalise the economy and cut tax in his first 15 month in office. But popular perception of an arrogant president whose monarchical style leaf him detached from the daily reality of most French people triggered street unrest in late 2018.

The original Benalla scandal became a major headache for Macron just over a year into his tenure, after the president, whose popularity rating have since slipped, wa criticised for acting too slowly in dealing with a member of his inner circle. Benalla said in an interview with France’s Journal du Dimanche (JDD) on Sunday that he would return the diplomatic passport in the coming days, and rejected that he wa somehow trying to profit from his status a a former insider by using them or in his work a a consultant. “Maybe I wa wrong to use these passports,” Benalla said, in a telephone conversation from overseas according to the JDD. “But I want to make it clear that I only did it for my own ease, to facilitate my passage through airports.” The French presidency ha sought to distance itself from the former bodyguard, and the government said it had formally requested the passport be returned on at least two occasions. Paris prosecutor on Saturday opened a preliminary inquiry into Benalla’s usage of the passports. Benalla maintained in the JDD, however, that he had initially returned the two ID document in August, and that they were returned to him along with other personal item by a member of the president’s staff in October.

The unsuccessful rescue bid ha drawn criticism of a lack of urgency shown by government agencies, particularly given the remote location of the mine, a journey to which can take more than five hour from the nearest commercial airport in Guwahati. “Would we have cared more if the miner had not been at the fringe of national consciousness in the northeast?” senior journalist Vir Sanghvi asked on Twitter. “I have not given up hope, but our response to this crisis shame u a a nation.” Additional reporting by Zarir Hussain in GUWAHATI; Writing by Krishna N.

Israeli medium report said at least three settler were also hurt. At least seven people were arrested for attacking officers, police said. The evacuation wa carried out after the Jerusalem District Court on Wednesday denied the settlers’ petition against eviction. Most country consider all Israeli settlement on land occupied in the 1967 Middle East war to be illegal. Israel dispute this, and last week Israeli authority issued approval for more than 2,000 settler home in the West Bank. Some 500,000 Israelis live in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, which wa also captured by Israel in the 1967 conflict. The two area are home to more than 2.6 million Palestinians. While Israel’s settlement project have regularly drawn condemnation from the Palestinians and in Europe, the U.S. administration under President Donald Trump ha taken a largely uncritical public stand.

Hasina’s ruling alliance won more than 90 percent of the seat contested in Sunday’s election, which wa marred by accusation of ballot stuffing, voter intimidation and violence that killed at least 17 people. Hasina and her ruling Awami League party have dismissed the accusations. While newly elected member of parliament from the ruling bloc, including Hasina, were sworn in, the seven opposition member stayed away. “Why should we take the oath when we’ve rejected this election?” Mirza Fakhrul Islam, secretary general of the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), told reporters. Islam is one of the seven opposition member who won a seat. Hasina ha denied any election impropriety, calling it a peaceful vote that saw enthusiastic participation. The Election Commission ha rejected an opposition call for a new vote, but despite that, the opposition alliance on Thursday submitted a new demand for a re-run of the polls. “Our each and every candidate will file a case with the election tribunal in their respective seat rejecting the result and bringing allegation of vote fraud,” Islam said. The BNP, which boycotted the previous election, in 2014, ha been hobbled by the absence of it leader, former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, 74, who wa jailed in February on corruption charge her party say were politically motivated. The party ha asked the government for permission to meet Khaleda.

The crash, the world’s first of a Boeing Co (BA.N) 737 MAX jet and the deadliest of 2018, killed all 189 people on board. Contact with flight JT610 wa lost 13 minute after it took off on Oct. 29 from the capital Jakarta heading north to the tin-mining town of Pangkal Pinang. The main wreckage and the CVR, one of two so-called black boxes, were not recovered in an initial search. Lion Air said in December it wa funding a 38 billion rupiah ($2.64 million) search using the offshore supply ship MPV Everest. The search using the ship ended on Saturday, Danang Mandala, the spokesman for Lion Air Group, told Reuters. A spokesman for the National Transportation Safety Commission (KNKT), however, said on Thursday the agency would start it own search for the black box a soon a feasible. The CVR is likely to hold vital clue that could give investigator insight into the action of the pilots. The KNKT spokesman said negotiation with the Indonesian navy were under way to use a navy ship to relaunch the search for the second black box a soon a possible. “It might be a soon a next week. It won’t be a fancy a the (Lion-subsidized) MPV Everest but will be equipped with a CVR detector and we already have a remote-operated vehicle,” the commission’s spokesman said. The clock is ticking in the hunt for acoustic ping from the L3 Technologies Inc CVR fitted to the jet. It ha a 90-day beacon, the manufacturer’s online brochure shows. A preliminary report by KNKT focused on airline maintenance and training and the response of a Boeing anti-stall system to a recently replaced sensor but did not give a cause for the crash. “While we appreciate the fact Lion Air Group brought out the MPV Everest ship, we are disappointed because there’s no actual results,” Anton Sahadi, a relative of a victim of the plane crash, told Reuters by a text message. “It ha been a waste of money, of time and of a sophisticated ship ... for several weeks, we the family of victim were given only fake promise by Lion Air,” he said, adding he wa not confident in the government’s efforts. The family of the Indonesian co-pilot of the flight filed a wrongful death lawsuit on Friday against Boeing in Chicago, adding to litigation piling up against the planemaker. [L1N1YX156] The lawsuit alleges that the Lion Air-operated Boeing 737 MAX jet wa unreasonably dangerous because it sensor provided inconsistent information to both the pilot and the aircraft. At least two other lawsuit have been filed against Boeing in Chicago by relative of victims. There ha also been some debate among expert over Indonesian authorities’ decision to ask Lion Air to pay for the search that ended on Saturday. Safety expert say air accident investigation agency typically lead the search for black box with public funding to ensure the independence of the process and that it is unusual to hand the task to one of the party to the investigation. Indonesian investigator previously said that bureaucratic wrangling and funding problem had hampered the search for the Lion Air CVR and they had turned to the airline for help. In 2007, effort to recover the black box from a crashed Adam Air jet were delayed by disagreement between the Indonesia and the airline over who should bear the cost. ($1 = 14,405.0000 rupiah)',\n",

       " 'U.S. commander planning for the withdrawal of U.S. troop from Syria are recommending that Kurdish fighter battling Islamic State be allowed to keep U.S.-supplied weapons, four U.S. official said, a move that would likely anger NATO ally Turkey. Three of the officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the recommendation were part of discussion on a draft plan by the U.S. military. It is unclear what the Pentagon will ultimately recommend to the White House. Discussions are still at an early stage inside the Pentagon and no decision ha yet been made, the official said. The plan will then be presented to the White House in the coming day with U.S. President Donald Trump making the final decision. The Pentagon said it would be “inappropriate” and premature to comment on what will happen with the weapons. “Planning is ongoing, and focused on executing a deliberate and controlled withdrawal of force while taking all measure possible to ensure our troops’ safety,” said Commander Sean Robertson, a Pentagon spokesman.The White House did not comment. Trump last week abruptly ordered a complete withdrawal of U.S. troop from Syria, drawing widespread criticism and prompting Defence Secretary Jim Mattis’ resignation. The U.S. official said Trump’s announcement ha upset U.S. commanders, who view his decision a a betrayal of the Kurdish YPG militia, which ha led the fight to eradicate Islamic State from northeastern Syria. Ankara view the YPG a an extension of a Kurdish insurgency inside Turkey. Turkey ha threatened to launch an offensive against the YPG, raising fear of a surge in violence that could harm hundred of thousand of civilians. The United States told the YPG that they would be armed by Washington until the fight against Islamic State wa completed, one of the U.S. official said. “The fight isn’t over. We can’t simply start asking for the weapon back,” said the official. The proposal to leave U.S.-supplied weapon with the YPG, which could include anti-tank missiles, armoured vehicle and mortars, would reassure Kurdish ally that they were not being abandoned. But Turkey want the United States to take the weapon back, so the commanders’ recommendation, if confirmed, could complicate Trump’s plan to allow Turkey to finish off the fight against Islamic State inside Syria. The Pentagon keep record of the weapon it ha supplied to the YPG and their chain of custody. But, the U.S. official said, it would be nearly impossible to locate all of the equipment. “How are we going to get them back and who is going to take them back?” one of the official asked. The debate over whether to leave weapon with the YPG coincides with Trump’s national security adviser John Bolton’s visit to Turkey and Israel next week for talk on Syria. In May 2017, the United States started distributing arm and equipment to the YPG for an offensive against Raqqa, the de facto capital of the self-declared caliphate that Islamic State overran in Iraq and Syria in 2014. The United States told Turkey that it would take back the weapon after the defeat of Islamic State, which ha lost all but a few sliver of territory in northeastern Syria. “The idea that we’d be able to recover them is asinine. So we leave them where they are,” said a U.S. official. A person familiar with the discussion of the U.S. withdrawal plan said the White House and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan would oppose the proposal to allow the YPG to keep it U.S.-supplied weapons. The recommendation “is a rejection of Trump’s policy to withdraw from Syria,” said the person, who asked not to be further identified. Turkey ha said weapon supplied to the YPG have in the past ended up in the hand of it Kurdish separatists, and described any weapon given to the insurgent a a threat to Turkey’s security. A phone call between Trump and Erdogan led to the decision to withdraw all U.S. force from Syria. In the call two week ago, Trump had been expected to deliver a standard warning to the Turkish president over his plan to launch a crossborder attack targeting U.S.-backed Kurdish force in northeast Syria, U.S. official said. Instead, in the course of the conversation, Trump reshaped U.S. policy in the Middle East, abandoning a quarter of Syrian territory and handing Turkey the job of finishing off Islamic State in Syria.',\n",

A spokesman for the federal government wa not immediately available to comment. The city government refused to comment. Both the federal government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Arvind Kejriwal’s Delhi government have not announced any measure to fight pollution this year. Cold weather ha forced some people, especially those spending the night in the open, to burn small fire to keep warm, adding to the smog. Unfavorable weather condition have worsened the crisis, but government measure have also failed to improve air quality in New Delhi and elsewhere. As pollution spiked in the city in October and November, the government adopted measure ranging from a temporary ban on construction activity and garbage burning to a clampdown on polluting industrial plants, such a coal-fired power stations. Critics say the measure were inadequate and poorly implemented, largely because of a lack of resource and political will to fight the toxic air, which ha driven a spurt in patient battling pollution-related health issues. India is home to the world’s 14 most polluted cities, with Delhi the sixth worst, the World Health Organization said in a report this year. Toxic air claimed 1.24 million life in India last year, or 12.5 percent of total deaths, a study published in Lancet Planetary Health showed this month. “India cut a sorry figure because of the report from international bodies,” said Dahiya. “If a country fails to give clean air to it people, agency like the WHO and Lancet will talk about it.” Editing by Martin Howell and Clarence Fernandez All quote delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

       " \"Patrick Shanahan wa thrust into the spotlight during his debut a acting U.S. defence secretary on Wednesday, sitting next to President Donald Trump a he publicly disparaged Shanahan’s predecessor, lampooned the war in Afghanistan and called Syria a land of “sand” and “death.” The former deputy defence secretary officially took office during the New Year’s holiday on Tuesday, issuing a statement saying that he looked “forward to working with President Trump to carry out his vision.” Trump’s vision for the second half of his four-year term in office came into view on Wednesday a he spoke exhaustively during a cabinet meeting about America’s wars, and his displeasure with them. Shanahan, a former Boeing executive, sat silently at Trump’s side, often expressionless, a television camera rolled. Trump suggested that former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis - who abruptly resigned last month over policy difference with Trump - had been essentially fired and that Mattis had failed in Afghanistan, where Taliban insurgent are becoming increasingly confident of ending the 17-year-old war on term favourable to them. “I’m not happy with what he’s done in Afghanistan and I shouldn’t be happy,” Trump said. The remark put Shanahan in a difficult position from the start of what could be a long tenure at the Pentagon, where many staff were loyal to Mattis. Trump ha suggested Shanahan could be acting a defence secretary for an extended period of time. Several candidate previously seen a potential successor to Mattis have recently indicated they don’t want the job, official say. Mattis’ public resignation could also make Senate confirmation perilous for any hand-picked successor. Mattis implicitly criticized Trump in his resignation letter for failing to value ally who fight alongside the United States, including in place like Syria. Even Shanahan had been picked by Mattis for the deputy job and held him in high regard, official say. As deputy, Shanahan often had to fill in for Mattis in meetings, including those with cabinet members. One reason Mattis resigned wa Trump’s surprise decision to order the withdrawal of U.S. force from Syria. Although Trump ha declared victory there, critic warn Islamic State still ha a toehold, and could stage a comeback if U.S. force depart. Trump said during the cabinet meeting that Islamic State militant should be combated by nation in the region, including U.S. adversary Iran. “It’s sand and it’s death,” he said. Shanahan ha yet to detail his thought on the way forward in Syria, where the Pentagon plan a gradual withdrawal of U.S. troop over the coming months. He ha also not commented on planning for a dramatic drawdown in Afghanistan. Seth Jones at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think-tank in Washington said Shanahan started the job from a somewhat weaker position, a he did not have the mandate of having been confirmed by the Senate. “Second, the president ha made major decision on a range of these (national security) issues,” Jones said. In one of his first meeting of the day, Shanahan told civilian leader of the U.S. military to focus on “China, China, China,” even a America fight militant in Syria and Afghanistan, a U.S. defence official said. The U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, did not elaborate on Shanahan’s view on China or other guidance he gave. Other official have described Shanahan a an advocate of the Pentagon's toughening stance towards Beijing. The 2018 National Defense Strategy here, which Shanahan helped develop, branded China a a strategic competitor. “While we’re focussed on ongoing operations, acting Secretary Shanahan told the team to remember China, China, China,” the official said. Relations between the world’s two largest economy have plumbed new depth under Trump, with a trade war and disagreement over Taiwan and the South China Sea. In Beijing on Thursday, a foreign ministry spokesman said China valued relation between the military of the two countries. “If what we mutually seek is a partner, then we will likely get a partner. If what we seek is an adversary, then we will certainly get an adversary,” Lu Kang told a regular news briefing, when asked about Shanahan’s remarks. Shanahan, best known for his focus on internal Pentagon reform and his private-sector experience, had spent three decade at Boeing and wa general manager for the 787 Dreamliner passenger jet before he joined the Pentagon. During Shanahan’s tense Senate confirmation hearing in 2017, the committee’s then-chairman, John McCain, voiced deep concern about giving the deputy job to an executive from one of the five corporation accounting for the lion’s share of U.S. defence spending. “I have to have confidence that the fox is not going to be put back into the henhouse,” said McCain, who died in August. Shanahan ha recused himself from participating in Boeing-related issues, a spokesman said.\",\n",

The outbreak occurred on a farm in Suihua city with 73,000 pig in northeastern Heilongjiang province, owned by the Heilongjiang Asia-Europe Animal Husbandry Co Ltd, a company established in 2016. The farm’s herd included 15,000 breeding pigs, according to it website, and it wa aiming to produce 385,000 pig for slaughter a year. Some 4,686 pig had been infected and 3,766 animal died, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said late on Wednesday. All animal on infected farm must be culled under current rules. The farm is the largest yet to be hit by the disease, which ha infected almost 100 farm across China since August 2018, spreading faster than in any other country to date. More than 200,000 pig on infected farm have been culled, according to a Reuters tally of official figures, while hundred of thousand more in the vicinity have also been put down. China ha the world’s largest hog herd and the rapid spread of African swine fever ha roiled the country’s trade in pork, the nation’s most popular meat, disrupting supply and pushing up price in some areas. Neither Heilongjiang Asia-Europe Animal Husbandry nor it majority owner, state-owned Zhejiang Rural Development Group Co. Ltd, responded to call for comment. Steffen Schiottz-Christensen, vice president for North Asia at Denmark state fund IFU, confirmed the outbreak but declined to comment further a he had yet to be fully briefed. IFU, which provides risk capital and advice for investment in developing countries, invested 28.4 million DKK (3.44 million pounds) in the farm in 2017, according to it website, although it shareholding ha since been diluted, Schiottz-Christensen said. “The African swine fever situation is only getting worse. Small farms, big farms, slaughterhouses, feed - the whole production chain basically all got hit,” said Yao Guiling, an analyst with consultancy China-America Commodity Data Analytics. Beijing ha banned feeding kitchen waste to pigs, and restricted transport of live pig and product from infected areas. But the virus ha now reached 23 province and municipality across China. The disease is deadly to pig but doe not affect humans. “The policy are good, but the increasing outbreak show that there might be some problem with execution at the local government level,” said Yao. China’s agriculture ministry also said on Wednesday that slaughterhouse will need to test their pork product for African swine fever before selling them to the market.

       " 'U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he had received a “great” letter from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and would probably meet him again in the not-too-distant future a part of effort to persuade him to give up his nuclear weapons. Speaking to reporter at the White House, Trump defended stuttering U.S. negotiation with Kim, saying that if it had not been for his administration “you’d be having a nice big fat war in Asia.” He reiterated that there wa no hurry. “I’m not in any rush. I don’t have to rush. All I know is there’s no rockets, there’s no testing,” he said, referring to North Korea’s nuclear and missile test that have been halted since the second half of 2017. Trump said he had watched coverage of Kim’s New Year speech on the U.S. Public Broadcasting Service. “They said that in Chairman Kim’s speech he really want to get together, he want to denuclearize and a lot of good thing are happening,” Trump said. “They really do want to do something. Now, doe that mean it’s going to be done? Who knows? A deal’s a deal, you never know, but I tell you, we’ve established a very good relationship with North Korea.” “We’ll probably now have another meeting. He’d like to meet, I’d like to meet,” Trump said. “We’ll set that up, we’ll be setting that up in the not-too-distant future.” Kim vowed to work towards denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula when he met Trump for the first time at a summit in Singapore in June, but there ha been little concrete progress since. Kim said in a nationally televised New Year address on Tuesday that he wa ready to meet again with Trump anytime, but warned he may take a “new path” if U.S. sanction and pressure continued. Trump, who in 2017 threatened to rain “fire and fury like the world ha never seen” on North Korea because of the threat it nuclear weapon and missile posed to the United States, said a world war had been averted. “That wa going to be a war - there could have been a World War Three to be honest with you ... And instead, we have somebody who I really think want to get on to economic development and making a lot of success and money, frankly, for his country.” Trump said North Korea had “tremendous” potential, and added: “We’ll help them out too.” On Monday, South Korea’s Chosun Ilbo newspaper reported that Kim had sent a message to Trump regarding the stalled nuclear talks. The report did not include detail about the “letter-like” communication. Trump told reporter on Wednesday the letter wa “great” and that he would love to read it out loud, but did not do so. Trump ha said previously that a second summit with Kim wa likely in January or February, though he wrote on Twitter last month he wa “in no hurry.” In his address on Tuesday, Kim said denuclearization wa his “firm will” and North Korea had “declared at home and abroad that we would neither make and test nuclear weapon any longer nor use and proliferate them.” However, he warned that North Korea might be “compelled to explore a new path” to defend it sovereignty if the United States “seeks to force something upon u unilaterally ... and remains unchanged in it sanction and pressure.” In spite of Trump’s words, Kim’s comment have fuelled doubt over whether North Korea intends to give up a nuclear weapon programme it ha long considered essential to it security. Analysts said Kim’s message sent clear signal that North Korea, which ha sought acceptance a a “responsible” nuclear power, wa willing to stay in talk with Washington and Seoul this year - but on it own terms. North Korea’s main state-run Rodong Sinmun newspaper said in a commentary on Thursday last year saw “wonderful changes” and “great movements” in North Korea’s relation with the South Korea and the United States, but progress in inter-Korean relation were “locked up in stagnation” because of U.S policies. “The U.S. still remains unchanged in the policy hostile towards the DPRK,” the paper wrote, using the initial of North Korea’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. The paper accused the United States of having a “a sinister intention to deprive the DPRK of it nuclear weapon and bring it to it knee without goodwill to build a new, good relationship with the DPRK”. “The U.S. is urged to do what it should do for the improvement of the DPRK-U.S. relations, not making useless admonition while meddling in the issue of north-south relations, an internal issue of the Korean nation,” it said. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made several trip to Pyongyang last year but the two side have yet to reschedule an abruptly cancelled November meeting between him and senior North Korean official Kim Yong Chol aimed at paving the way for a second summit. As well a demanding a lifting of sanctions, Pyongyang ha been seeking an official end to the 1950-1953 Korean War in response to it initial, unilateral step that have included dismantling it only known nuclear testing site and a missile engine facility. U.S. official have said the extent of initial North Korean step wa not confirmed and could be easily reversed. Washington ha halted some large-scale military exercise with South Korea to aid negotiations, but ha called for strict global sanction enforcement until North Korea’s full, verifiable denuclearization.',\n",
       " 'North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said on Tuesday he is ready to meet U.S. President Donald Trump again anytime to achieve their common goal of denuclearising the Korean Peninsula, but warned he may have to take an alternative path if U.S. sanction and pressure against the country continued. In a nationally televised New Year address, Kim said denuclearisation wa his “firm will” and North Korea had “declared at home and abroad that we would neither make and test nuclear weapon any longer nor use and proliferate them.” Kim added that Pyongyang had “taken various practical measures” and if Washington responded “with trustworthy measure and corresponding practical action ... bilateral relation will develop wonderfully at a fast pace.” “I am always ready to sit together with the U.S. president anytime in the future, and will work hard to produce result welcomed by the international community without fail,” Kim said. However, he warned that North Korea might be “compelled to explore a new path” to defend it sovereignty if the United States “seeks to force something upon u unilaterally ... and remains unchanged in it sanction and pressure.” It wa not clear what Kim meant by “a new path,” but his comment are likely to further fuel scepticism over whether North Korea intends to give up a nuclear weapon programme that it ha long considered essential to it security. In response to the news, Trump wrote on Twitter, “I also look forward to meeting with Chairman Kim who realizes so well that North Korea posse great economic potential!” There wa no immediate comment from the White House. Asked for a reaction, a U.S. State Department official said: “We decline the opportunity to comment.” South Korea’s presidential office, however, welcomed Kim’s speech, saying it carried his “firm will” to advance relation with Seoul and Washington. Kim and Trump vowed to work towards denuclearisation and build “lasting and stable” peace at their landmark summit in Singapore in June, but little progress ha been made since. Trump ha said a second summit with Kim is likely in January or February, though he wrote on Twitter last month that he wa “in no hurry.” U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made several trip to Pyongyang last year but the two side have yet to reschedule a meeting between him and senior North Korean official Kim Yong Chol after an abrupt cancellation in November. Pyongyang ha demanded Washington lift sanction and declare an official end to the 1950-1953 Korean War in response to it initial, unilateral step towards denuclearisation, including dismantling it only known nuclear testing site and a key missile engine facility. U.S. official have said the extent of initial North Korean step were not confirmed and could be easily reversed. Washington ha halted some large-scale military exercise with Seoul to aid negotiations, but ha called for strict global sanction enforcement on impoverished North Korea until it full, verifiable denuclearisation. Kim’s reference to pledge not to make nuclear weapon could indicate a first moratorium on such weapon production, although it wa not clear if this wa conditional. While Pyongyang conducted no nuclear or missile test last year, satellite image have pointed to continued activity at related facilities. The U.S. special representative for North Korea, Stephen Biegun, reiterated last month that Washington had no intention of easing sanction but had agreed to help South Korea send flu medication to North Korea, saying such cooperation could help advance nuclear diplomacy. Analysts said Kim’s message sent clear signal that North Korea wa willing to stay in talk with Washington and Seoul this year - but on it own terms. “North Korea seems determined in 2019 to receive some sort of sanction relief ... The challenge, however, is will Team Trump be willing to back away from it position of zero sanction relief?” said Harry Kazianis of the Washington-based Centre for the National Interest. “Kim’s remark seem to suggest his patience with America is wearing thin.” After racing towards the goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the United States in 2017, Kim used last year’s New Year speech to warn that “a nuclear button is always on the desk of my office” and order mass production of nuclear bomb and ballistic missiles. But he also offered to send a delegation to the 2018 Winter Olympics in the South in February, setting off a flurry of diplomacy that included three summit with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, and the meeting with Trump in June. This year, Kim said inter-Korean relation had entered a “completely new phase,” and offered to resume key inter-Korean economic project banned under international and South Korean sanctions, without conditions.',\n",
       " 'In his New Year address on Tuesday, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un warned he might take a “new path” if Washington maintains sanction amid his country’s push for economic development, but expert say it may be too late to change the trajectory of negotiations. Kim did not specify what the new approach might be. His warning may sound similar to the bellicose rhetoric that Pyongyang often deployed before last year’s summit, but he cannot jeopardise the hard-won thaw and ha few option beyond appealing directly to U.S. President Donald Trump, expert say. State medium have in recent week accused the State Department of risking returning to “exchanges of fire” of the past by ramping up sanctions, while crediting Trump for his effort to continue talks. As both side struggle to find a breakthrough in stalled talks, the speech show Kim shifting the focus from call for complete dismantlement of it nuclear arsenal and hinting at including country other than the United States. A: Kim vowed to work towards denuclearisation at a summit with Trump in Singapore in June. But since then there ha been little progress, with a high-level meeting between the two side cancelled abruptly in November. Pyongyang ha demanded Washington lift sanction and declare a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War in response to the dismantlement of it Punggye-ri nuclear testing site and a key missile engine facility. Despite goodwill response from Washington, such a a halt of some major military exercise with South Korea, U.S. official have said North Korea’s initial step were not confirmed and could be easily reversed. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said North Korea would not be forced to provide a list of nuclear weapon and locations, and a U.S. nuclear envoy offered to facilitate humanitarian aid. But Kim’s speech on Tuesday called for a “complete end” to all joint exercise and slammed the sanction campaign. “His message wa ‘we have done what we said we would at Singapore, but the United States ha done very little in return,’” said Vipin Narang, a political scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. A: North Korea’s state medium ha stepped up criticism of the United States, warning of a return to the era of confrontation if sanction and pressure continued. But that indicates Pyongyang’s frustration rather than the “new path” Kim suggested, expert say. “One thing is clear: Kim is not going to return to any sort of posture where the U.S. or it ally would consider a military attack, and that mean no missile or nuclear test for the foreseeable future,” said Harry Kazianis of the Washington-based Centre for the National Interest. Instead, “new path” may refer to focussing on concession that don’t involve broad denuclearisation in favour of action-for-action commitments. South Korea’s Unification Ministry said on Wednesday it could not speculate on what the alternative path might be, but Kim showed his “clear resolve” to abandon the weapon programme and improve U.S. tie by mentioning “complete denuclearisation” himself for the first time. Kim Joon-hyung, a professor at Handong Global University, said one possible scenario wa the North’s dismantling of the Yongbyon nuclear complex, a offered at an inter-Korean summit in September in Pyongyang, and acknowledging some facility in return for eased sanctions, such a a partial restart of inter-Korean economic projects. Kim Jong Un said in the speech he wa willing to reopen the Kaesong factory park and allow access to the North’s Mount Kumgang resort “without conditions.” Yet there remains an opportunity to limit Kim’s arsenal, said Patrick Cronin of the Hudson Institute in Washington. “This will not be easy, and neither side will achieve outright success, but diplomacy is possible,” Cronin said. “China and others may also be invited to play a role.” A: The New Year address called for a launch of multilateral talk to officially declare an end to the Korean War, an idea also floated previously by South Korea. That could mean working with China, South Korea and others in pressing Washington, professor Kim said. But other experts, including former South Korean nuclear envoy Lee Soo-hyuk, were sceptical that would happen given the deadlocked bilateral talks, the Sino-U.S. trade war and Trump’s dislike for multinational mechanisms. “Kim can present Trump with a choice: Either play ball with me on a negotiated nuclear settlement and reduce sanction or I will go to China for help and get the economic development I want and keep my nukes,” Kazianis said.',\n",
       " 'No agreement came out of a meeting between U.S. congressional leader and President Donald Trump on Wednesday to end a partial government shutdown now in it 12th day a the president stuck to his demand for $5 billion (3.97 billion pounds) in border wall funding fiercely opposed by Democrats. Congressional leader are expected to return to the White House on Friday to resume talks, signalling the shutdown will likely stretch into the weekend. The White House convened the meeting to try to convince Democrats that funding a wall on the southern border with Mexico wa a pressing security need. Instead, Democratic leader cut off Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Neilsen’s presentation and tried to no avail to press Trump to accept their offer. “It just wa not a credible presentation,” Senator Dick Durbin said of the briefing. He added that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, who is expected to be elected House speaker on Thursday, insisted the conversation focus instead on the shutdown. Pelosi said the House would proceed with plan to hold vote on Thursday, when they formally take control of the chamber from Trump’s fellow Republicans, on legislation that would end the shutdown without providing the wall money sought by Trump. “We’re asking the president to open up government,” Pelosi told reporter outside the White House after the meeting. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said afterward on the Senate floor that the chamber would not vote on the legislation, calling it a “political sideshow” and “total nonstarter.” Democrats say they want to fund most of the government through September, but allow for another month to negotiate wall funding by only partially funding the Department of Homeland Security, which is responsible for the wall. Schumer said Trump conceded that Republicans would lose leverage if they allowed the rest of the government to be funded. “We asked him to give u one good reason ... why you should continue your shutdown of the eight Cabinet department while we are debating our difference on homeland security. He could not give a good answer,” Schumer told reporter after the meeting. In a tweet on Wednesday evening, Trump called the meeting “important” and said he would continue talk with Democrats “to pas a bill that secures our borders, support the agent and officer on the ground, and keep America Safe.” Trump’s demand for $5 billion in funding for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border triggered the shutdown affecting about a quarter of the federal government and 800,000 federal workers. Before meeting with lawmakers, Trump said the shutdown would last for “as long a it takes” a he push for wall money a part of any legislation to reopen agency shuttered when their funding lapsed on Dec. 22. “It could be a long time,” Trump told reporter on Wednesday during a Cabinet meeting, “or it could be quickly.” “We know that we have a challenge along the border,” said Kevin McCarthy, the top House Republican. “We want to solve that issue. We want to make sure we open this government up. And I think at the end of the day, the president, listening to him, he want to solve this a well.” Pelosi noted that the legislation being presented in the House had previously won backing in the Senate, which will remain in Republican hand in the new 2019-2020 Congress that convenes on Thursday. But McConnell said previously that Senate Republicans would not approve a spending measure Trump doe not support. Trump made the border wall a key part of his presidential campaign. Before meeting with the Democrats, Trump called the border a “sieve,” rebutted Pelosi’s complaint that a wall wa immoral, provided an estimate of the U.S. illegal immigrant population far higher than the figure most expert cite and made disputed comment about progress towards building a wall. The visit by Pelosi and Schumer wa their first to the White House since their sharp exchange with Trump in the Oval Office on Dec. 11 during which the president told them he would be “proud to shut down the government for border security.” He ha since blamed Democrats for the shutdown. The $5 billion Trump is seeking would cover only a portion of the money needed for a border wall, a project estimated to cost about $23 billion. Trump had said Mexico would pay for the wall, but Mexico ha refused.',\n",
       " 'As Ralph Snake walked across Washington’s National Mall on Wednesday, he stopped every few foot to pick up litter that ha accumulated in the once-tidy expanse of grass since a budget showdown partially closed the federal government 12 day ago. “I decided to clean up this one section, because that’s what Americans will do,” said Snake, a 64-year-old member of the indigenous Ho-Chunk Nation in Wisconsin. Snake came to the U.S. capital to witness Sharice Davids get sworn in a one of the first two woman of native American descent to become member of Congress. The partial shutdown, which ha cut off many government services, entered it 12th day on Wednesday with no end in sight. It stem from an impasse between congressional Democrats, who control the House of Representatives a of Thursday, and President Donald Trump, who is demanding $5.6 billion (4.5 billion pounds) in funding for a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico. National park have closed campground out of fear that toilet will overflow with human waste. Hundreds of thousand of federal employee are working without pay. The immigration court system, already suffocating under a backlog, is largely shuttered. The prospect for an end to the showdown remained unclear, even a congressional leader visited the White House on Wednesday. In Washington, the 17 museum run by the Smithsonian a well a the National Zoo closed their door on Wednesday after running out of emergency funding, leaving tourist frustrated with politician of both parties. “It’s stupid,” said Laura Vanbragt, a 20-year-old student from Grand Rapids, Michigan. “There should just be more communication between the two, more give on both sides.” Outside the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, Clint Woods and his family stood waiting for a guided tour with other visitor who were locked out of more popular venues. “It’s like two squabbling children,” Woods, 43, said of Trump and Democratic leader in Congress. “They both think they’re right, and they’re dug in.” At Joshua Tree National Park, which is named after the spiked yucca plant that grow all over the park’s desert landscape, road and scenic turnout were full of car on Wednesday but campground were closed. Rock climber Kiera Waskey, 21, and Stefan Nelson, 22, were able to camp in the park for three night after arriving on a visit from Minnesota. “We were told that today we had to clean up camp and we can’t camp here anymore, which wa a bummer,” Waskey said, standing near rock outcropping dotted by several climbers. “I guess we take it for granted almost, these beautiful place that we have and we never thought we’d have to prepare for it (the shutdown),” he said. Public bathroom and trash bin at the park were well kept, because volunteer were cleaning them, visitor said. The booth at the park’s entrance wa closed, so visitor were able to roll in without paying an entrance fee. Frequent park visitor Marie Hoffman and Trevor Goodman, who are both 19 and student at University of California, Davis, said they noticed a lot more climber and general visitor than they normally see at the park. “It look like Disneyland today with just all the car and everything, so many visitors,” Hoffman said, attributing the increased traffic to the temporary lack of an entrance fee. Unlike in some previous government shutdowns, many national park have remained open, though without staff to collect trash and service restrooms. Advocates have voiced alarm that an extended shutdown could cause environmental damage. “We’re very concerned about the report we’re seeing of human waste in inappropriate places,” said John Garder, senior director of budget and appropriation for the National Parks Conservation Association. “Trash is a serious concern for wildlife.” The impact of the shutdown ha reached the nation’s 62 immigration court a well. Hundreds of judge are on furlough, and only case of immigrant in detention are being heard. The Trump administration ha expanded the system, which is run by the U.S. Department of Justice, aiming to cut down on the backlog of more than 800,000 cases, but the shutdown will complicate that effort, said Ashley Tabaddor, the president of the national immigration judges’ union. “To reschedule these case can take several year because the judge are all booked,” she said. A Justice Department spokesman said he could not respond to a request for comment because of the shutdown. Meanwhile, some 800,000 government worker are either furloughed or working without pay until the shutdown ends. Shekina Givens, a 32-year-old Transportation Security Administration officer in Atlanta and president of the local chapter of a union that represents government employees, said she is avoiding using her credit card and putting off some expenses. “I’m the only person that’s working in my household and paying all the bills,” she said.',\n",

       " 'Peru Attorney General Pedro Chavarry on Wednesday reappointed two lead prosecutor he had dismissed from a high-profile graft probe after the decision sparked widespread opposition and a threat by President Martin Vizcarra to suspend him. The prosecutors, Rafael Vela and Jose Domingo Perez, had recently drawn up a plea deal with Odebrecht that committed the Brazilian construction company to providing evidence on some $30 million (23.9 million pounds) in bribe it say it paid to local politicians. The two are celebrated a anti-graft crusader by many Peruvians for going after high-profile politicians, including four former president and opposition leader Keiko Fujimori. But late on Monday, Chavarry announced he wa removing Vela and Perez from the case for exceeding their authority. By Wednesday, after protest and wave of criticism, Chavarry signed a resolution reappointing them to their posts, saying other prosecutor had declined to replace them. The reversal wa a fresh win for President Vizcarra, who had promised to do all he could to return the two prosecutor to the case. Earlier on Wednesday Vizcarra sent Congress legislation to suspend Chavarry from his post and declare a state of emergency in the attorney general’s office in order to restructure it. Chavarry ha denied that he sought to meddle in the Odebrecht probe by dismissing Perez and Vela. Vizcarra, who took office to replace former president Pedro Pablo Kuczynski after his resignation due to a graft scandal last year, ha made fighting corruption a core focus of his government. His approval rating at the end of 2018 exceeded 60 percent after reform he proposed to uproot entrenched corruption cronyism easily passed a national referendum. Vizcarra ha repeatedly called for Chavarry to step down, but under Peru’s constitution only Congress can force the attorney general from office. Odebrecht is at the centre of the “Car Wash” investigation in Brazil, which ha rippled across Latin America and which U.S. prosecutor have said is the biggest political graft scheme ever uncovered. In 2016, Odebrecht acknowledged it had paid million of dollar in bribe to official in a dozen country to secure public work contract dating back over a decade.

       " 'U.S. President Donald Trump’s attorney general nominee William Barr is expected to back away from prior criticism of an anti-fraud law that allows private individual to bring lawsuit on behalf of the government, a source familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. Barr will clarify his current thinking on the U.S. False Claims Act, which he ha previously called an unconstitutional “abomination,” when he go before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee in a confirmation hearing in coming months, the source said. Barr did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent to his law firm email account. The law allows whistleblower who expose fraud against the U.S. government to bring private lawsuit and keep a percentage of any damage awarded. In October, for example, the Justice Department agreed to a $93 million (73.9 million pounds) bounty for three whistleblower after drug wholesaler AmerisouceBergen Corp paid $625 million to resolve their allegation of Medicaid fraud. Business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, have criticized the False Claims Act (FCA) a primarily benefiting plaintiffs’ lawyer and their client instead of taxpayers. But the Justice Department ha raked in nearly $60 billion in FCA settlement and judgement since the law wa overhauled in 1986, including nearly $3 billion last year. The law also still enjoys the strong support of Iowa Republican and Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, who wa an architect of 1986 amendment that increased the FCA’s potency. In 1991, during Barr’s previous confirmation hearing to serve a attorney general under President George H.W. Bush, Grassley explicitly asked Barr to pledge support to the FCA’s whistleblower provisions. As a high-ranking Justice Department official in the Bush administration, Barr had authored a 1989 memorandum that concluded the law’s whistleblower provision violated the separation of power doctrine and other constitutional requirements. Barr later said in a 2001 interview for an oral history of the Bush presidency that he wanted the Justice Department to attack the constitutionality of the law but wa opposed by then Solicitor General Kenneth Starr. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled unanimously in 2000 that private whistleblower can sue on behalf of the U.S. government. Barr ha recently told others that his prior comment are outdated, according to the source. Barr belief DOJ’s current handling of FCA case protects federal interest and no longer think a constitutional challenge is warranted, the source said. Grassley is expected to cede chairmanship of the Judiciary Committee to Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, before Barr’s confirmation hearing. He hailed President Trump’s nomination of Barr in a statement last month. Grassley’s spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.',\n",

If confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate, Barr would take over from Matthew Whitaker, who ha been serving a acting attorney general since President Donald Trump forced out Jeff Sessions in November. The committee’s statement did not give detail on the planned hearings. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said last month that a memo Barr wrote criticizing Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into possible Russian interference in U.S. election should disqualify him from serving a attorney general. Barr wrote in the June 2018 memo to senior Justice Department official that Mueller “should not be able to demand that the President submit to an interrogation about alleged obstruction,” CNN ha reported.

U.S. Ambassador to Russia Jon Huntsman visited the detained man, Paul Whelan, at a detention facility in Moscow and spoke by phone with his family, the State Department said. The United States had expressed concern through diplomatic channel over delayed access to Whelan, who wa detained on Friday, a department spokesman said in a statement. “We’ve made clear to the Russians our expectation that we will learn more about the charges, come to understand what it is he’s been accused of and if the detention is not appropriate, we will demand his immediate return,” Pompeo said in Brasilia, where he attended the inauguration of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro on Tuesday. Russia’s FSB state security service opened a criminal case against Whelan but it gave no detail of his suspected espionage activities. Under Russian law, espionage can carry a prison sentence of between 10 and 20 years. Whelan’s family said on Tuesday that he wa visiting Moscow for the wedding of a retired Marine and is innocent of the espionage charge against him. He had been staying with the wedding party at Moscow’s Metropol hotel when he went missing, his brother David said. “His innocence is undoubted and we trust that his right will be respected,” Whelan’s family said in a statement. David Whelan told CNN that his brother, who had served in Iraq, ha been to Russia many time in the past for both work and personal trips, and had been acting a a tour guide for some of the wedding guests. His friend filed a missing person report in Moscow after his disappearance, his brother said. David Whelan did not immediately respond to request for additional information. Paul Whelan is 48 and life in Novi, Michigan, according to public records. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserves from May 10, 1994 to Dec. 2, 2008 and the highest rank he attained wa staff sergeant, according to record provided by the Pentagon. Whelan wa discharged for bad conduct following his conviction by court martial on charge related to larceny, the Pentagon said. BorgWarner Inc (BWA.N), a Michigan-based automotive part supplier, said Whelan is the company’s director of global security and oversees the safety of it facility in Auburn Hills, Michigan, and other locations. According to the company’s website, it doe not have any location in Russia. Daniel Hoffman, a former CIA Moscow station chief, said it wa “possible, even likely” that Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered Whelan’s arrest to set up an exchange for Maria Butina, a Russian citizen who pleaded guilty on Dec. 13 to acting a an agent to influence conservative group in the United States. Russia say Butina wa forced to make a false confession about being a Russian agent. Putin told U.S. President Donald Trump in a letter on Sunday that Moscow wa ready for dialogue on a “wide-ranging agenda,” the Kremlin said, following a series of attempt to schedule a second summit between the leaders. At the end of November, Trump cancelled a planned meeting with Putin on the sideline of a G20 summit in Argentina, citing tension about Russian force opening fire on Ukrainian navy boat and then seizing them. Trump’s relation with Putin have been under a microscope because of U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into suspected Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election and possible collusion with the Trump campaign. Moscow ha denied interfering in the election. Trump ha said there wa no collusion and characterized Mueller’s probe a a witch hunt.

The temporary decree, which will expire unless it is ratified within 120 day by Congress, mandate that the office of the Government Secretary, Carlos Alberto Dos Santos Cruz, “supervise, coordinate, monitor and accompany the activity and action of international organization and non-governmental organization in the national territory.” The order, signed late on Tuesday, is part of a raft of measure the far-right Bolsonaro administration implemented on it first day in power. Jose Miguel Vivanco, director of the Americas division of Human Rights Watch, said the decree on NGOs could be viewed in a positive light, but also expressed concerns. “If the purpose of the measure were to facilitate a constructive relationship between international civil society group and the government at it highest level, it would be a welcome step,” he said. “However, what strike me is the use of the term ‘supervise’ and ‘monitor’, which suggest a fundamental lack of understanding of the independent role that these entity play in any open and democratic society.” The decree did not give reason for the change, but Bolsonaro said on Twitter that NGOs had “exploited and manipulated” the country’s indigenous population of about 900,000. “Let u together integrate these citizen and value all Brazilians,” he wrote. The president’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Bolsonaro is a former army captain and his cabinet is full of former high-ranking military official - including Santos Cruz, a retired general. Brazil’s military ha long considered that the rich resource of the vast, sparsely-populated Amazon should be protected from any foreign interest. Environmental and right group were already upset by the new government’s decision to give the agriculture ministry power over indigenous land right decisions, and the latest move risk causing further tension with such groups. A longtime member of Congress, Bolsonaro said at his inauguration on Tuesday that his election had freed the country from “socialism and political correctness.”',\n",
       " 'President Donald Trump ha asked congressional leader to return to the White House on Friday for talk aimed at ending a partial government shutdown over a dispute on border security funding, House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy said on Wednesday. Speaking after a meeting of congressional leader with Trump at the White House, McCarthy said he believed the president wanted to find a solution to the crisis. “We know that we have a challenge along the border. We want to solve that issue. We want to make sure we open this government up. And I think at the end of the day, the president, listening to him, he want to solve this a well,” McCarthy said. Democrats said they would proceed with plan to hold vote on Thursday, when they formally take control of the U.S. House of Representatives from Trump’s fellow Republicans, on legislation that would end the shutdown without providing money for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border that Trump sought. The White House ha called the two-part package a “non-starter.” “We’re asking the president to open up government,” Democrat Nancy Pelosi, the presumptive House speaker, told reporter outside the White House after top lawmaker met with Trump and his homeland security officials.',\n",
       " 'New Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro issued an executive order on Wednesday making the Agriculture Ministry responsible for deciding on land claimed by indigenous peoples, in a victory for agribusiness that will likely enrage environmentalists. The temporary decree, which will expire unless it is ratified within 120 day by Congress, strip power over land claim decision from indigenous affair agency FUNAI. It say the Agriculture Ministry will now be responsible for “identification, delimitation, demarcation and registration of land traditionally occupied by indigenous people.” The move stoked concern among environmentalist and right group that the far-right president, who took office on Tuesday, will open up the vast Amazon rainforest and other ecologically sensitive area of Brazil to greater commercial exploitation. The executive order also move the Brazilian Forestry Service, which promotes the sustainable use of forest and is currently linked to the Environment Ministry, under Agriculture Ministry control. Additionally, the decree state that the Agriculture Ministry will be in charge of the management of public forests. Bolsonaro, who enjoys strong support from Brazil’s powerful agribusiness sector, said during his campaign he wa considering such a move, arguing that protected land should be opened to commercial activities. Brazil’s 900,000 indigenous people make up le than 1 percent of the population, but live on land that stretch for 106.7 million hectare (264 million acres), or 12.5 pct of the national territory. “Less than a million people live in these isolated place in Brazil, where they are exploited and manipulated by NGOs,” Bolsonaro tweeted, referring to non-profit groups. “Let u together integrate these citizen and value all Brazilians.” Critics say Bolsonaro’s plan to open indigenous reservation to commercial activity will destroy native culture and language by integrating the tribe into Brazilian society. Environmentalists say the native people are the last custodian of the Amazon, which is the world’s largest rainforest and is vital for climate stability. Adding to the gloom for NGOs, Bolsonaro also signed an executive order to give his government potentially far-reaching and restrictive power over non-governmental organization working in Brazil. The temporary decree mandate that the office of the Government Secretary, Carlos Alberto Dos Santos Cruz, “supervise, coordinate, monitor and accompany the activity and action of international organization and non-governmental organization in the national territory.” After she wa sworn in on Wednesday, new Agriculture Minister Tereza Cristina Dias defended the farm sector from accusation it ha grown at the expense of the environment, adding that the strength of Brazil’s farmer had generated “unfounded accusations” from unnamed international groups. Dias used to be the head of the farm caucus in Brazil’s Congress, which ha long pushed for an end to land measure that it argues hold back the agricultural sector. “Brazil is a country with extremely advanced environmental legislation and is more than able to preserve it native forests,” Dias said. “Our country is a model to be followed, never a transgressor to be punished.” In comment to reporter after her speech, she said that decision over land right dispute were a new responsibility for the Agriculture Ministry. However, she indicated that in practise, the demarcation of land limit would fall to a council of ministries, without giving further details. Bartolomeu Braz, the president of the national chapter of Aprosoja, a major grain grower association, cheered Wednesday’s move to transfer indigenous land demarcation to the Agriculture Ministry. “The new rule will be interesting to the farmer and the Indians, some of whom are already producing soybeans. The Indians want to be productive too,” he added. Three-time presidential candidate and former Environment Minister Marina Silva, who wa beaten by Bolsonaro in October’s election, reacted with horror to the move. “Bolsonaro ha begun his government in the worst possible way,” she wrote on Twitter. Dinamã Tuxá, a member of Brazil’s Association of Indigenous Peoples, said many isolated community viewed Bolsonaro’s administration with fear. “We are very afraid because Bolsonaro is attacking indigenous policies, rolling back environmental protections, authorizing the invasion of indigenous territory and endorsing violence against indigenous peoples,” said Tuxá. Under the new plan, the indigenous affair agency FUNAI will be moved into a new ministry for family, woman and human rights. A former army captain and longtime member of Congress, Bolsonaro said at his inauguration on Tuesday that he had freed the country from “socialism and political correctness.” An admirer of Donald Trump, Bolsonaro ha suggested he will follow the U.S. president’s lead and pull out of the Paris climate change accord. In addition to the indigenous land decree, the new administration issued decree affecting the economy and society on Wednesday, while forging closer tie with the United States.',\n",
       " 'U.S. President Donald Trump rebuffed sharp criticism from fellow Republican Mitt Romney on Wednesday, heaping scorn on the incoming senator in a sign of tension to come in Washington even before a new Congress is officially sworn in. Romney, who start work on Thursday when member of the 2019-2020 Congress take office, suggested in a newspaper essay published on Tuesday that Trump had “caused dismay around the world” and said his presidency had “made a deep descent in December.” “On balance, his conduct over the past two year ... is evidence that the president ha not risen to the mantle of the office,” said Romney in the Washington Post essay, reprising a strong critique of Trump that he voiced during the 2016 presidential campaign. Trump responded with a tweet on Wednesday, noting Romney’s failed 2012 White House bid and also taking a shot at former Republican Senator Jeff Flake, who ha just retired from Congress and who ha been one of the few Republican lawmaker to be openly critical of the president. “Here we go with Mitt Romney, but so fast! Question will be, is he a Flake? I hope not. Would much prefer that Mitt focus on Border Security and so many other thing where he can be helpful. I won big, and he didn’t. He should be happy for all Republicans. Be a TEAM player & WIN!” Trump wrote on Twitter. Trump repeated this theme later during a cabinet meeting, saying he wished Romney could be more of a “team player.” The president, a businessman and television star with no prior government experience, caused deep division in the party when he won the Republican White House nomination and then the election in 2016, upending party orthodoxy on foreign policy, deficit and other issue and governing in sometimes turbulent style. But public criticism from Republican lawmaker ha been rare. It wa unclear whether any other prominent member of the party would feel emboldened to criticise Trump ahead of his presumed 2020 re-election bid, or whether the president will face any serious challenger for the party’s White House nomination. Senator Rand Paul, a conservative Republican, took Romney to task on a conference call. “You’ll find the vast majority (of Republican lawmakers) will wish he hadn’t said it,” said Paul. Brushing aside the fact that Trump often personally attack and insult other politicians, Paul said Romney’s criticism of the president’s character wa a “big mistake” and an attempt by the new senator to present himself a “holier than thou.” “Some might say it’s sour grape at not having won the (presidential) post himself,” said Paul. He added: “I don’t think there’s an appetite for a Romney run (for president) in the Republican Party.” Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel also criticized Romney, saying on Twitter his essay wa an attack on Trump that wa “disappointing and unproductive.” McDaniel is a niece of Romney. Seven year ago, Romney wa the party’s presidential nominee, running with Paul Ryan, who retired from Congress last month. Romney lost to then incumbent Democratic President Barack Obama. Paul also took a run at the presidency. He dropped out early in 2016 from the Republican primary race that Trump won. Representatives for Romney could not be immediately reached for comment on the tweet and remark by Trump, Paul and McDaniel. Romney and Trump traded barb during the 2016 campaign, with Romney calling Trump a “fraud” and Trump slamming Romney’s 2012 loss. The two later appeared to bury the hatchet, with Trump briefly considering Romney to be his secretary of state and endorsing Romney’s 2018 run for the Senate. But in Tuesday’s essay, Romney wrote of Trump, “The appointment of senior person of lesser experience, the abandonment of ally who fight beside us, and the president’s thoughtless claim that America ha long been a ‘sucker’ in world affair all defined his presidency down.” He promised to speak his mind in Washington, which will now feature a divided Congress a Republicans retain a majority in the Senate and Democrats take control of the House of Representatives, after Republicans lost their House majority in November’s elections. “I will speak out against significant statement or action that are divisive, racist, sexist, anti-immigrant, dishonest or destructive to democratic institutions,” Romney wrote.

       " 'Results from Democratic Republic of Congo’s chaotic presidential election could be delayed past Sunday’s deadline because counting centre are still waiting for more than 80 percent of local tallies, the electoral commission said. The election, which is meant to mark Congo’s first democratic transfer of power, ha already been marred by violence and logistical problems. The opposition ha said there wa widespread fraud, an accusation dismissed by the government. As of Wednesday - three day after the election - counting centre had received just 17 percent of the tally sheet drawn up by individual polling stations, the president of the CENI electoral commission, Corneille Nangaa, told Reuters. “We will try a hard a possible to meet Sunday’s deadline, but it will be challenging,” Nangaa said. He did not say what wa causing the delays. A spokesman for Felix Tshisekedi, one of two opposition candidates, said the hold-up wa a further sign of fraud. “They are clearly trying to prolong the process to manipulate the truth of the ballots,” said Vidiye Tshimanga. There wa no immediate reaction from the government, though regional monitor earlier said the Dec. 30 vote wa “relatively well-managed” given the challenge involved. The election allowed “the majority of the Congolese population to exercise it right to vote,” the Southern African Development Community (SADC) said. Vote counting wa transparent, 59 percent of polling place it observed opened on time and police securing the poll behaved professionally, the organisation added. Approval of the election’s result by SADC power such a South Africa and Angola will be critical for the legitimacy of the administration of the next president, who will succeed veteran incumbent Joseph Kabila on Jan. 18. Angola and South Africa have been important ally of Kabila over the years, but relation were strained by his refusal to step down when his mandate officially expired in 2016. Pre-election polling showed Kabila’s preferred candidate, ex-interior minister Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, trailing the main opposition candidates, Martin Fayulu and Felix Tshisekedi, but both side say they expect to win. An African Union observer mission said in a separate statement on Wednesday that election day wa blighted by a number of logistical problems. “The holding of these election constitutes, in itself, a first great victory for the Congolese people,” it said. “The mission strongly wish that the result that will be declared are true to the vote of the Congolese people.” Kabila’s government refused to accredit election monitor from the European Union and the U.S.-based Carter Centre, which said there were widespread irregularity in the 2011 election. Contested election result in 2006 and 2011 led to violent street protests, and a disputed outcome this time could also destabilise Congo’s volatile eastern borderland with Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi, where dozen of militia group are active.

       " 'President Donald Trump’s declaration in a phone call with Tayyip Erdogan that he wa pulling U.S. troop from Syria ha stunned Turkey and left it scrambling to respond to the changing battlefield on it southern border. In the phone call two week ago, Trump had been expected to deliver a standard warning to the Turkish president over his plan to launch a crossborder attack targeting U.S.-backed Kurdish force in northeast Syria, U.S. official say. Instead, in the course of the conversation Trump reshaped U.S. policy in the Middle East, abandoning a quarter of Syrian territory and handing Ankara the job of finishing off Islamic State in Syria. “Trump asked: ‘If we withdraw our soldiers, can you clean up ISIS?’”, a Turkish official told Reuters. He said Erdogan replied that Turkish force were up to the task. “Then you do it,” Trump told him abruptly. To his national security adviser John Bolton, also on the call, Trump said: “Start work for the withdrawal of U.S. troop from Syria.” “I have to say it wa an unexpected decision. The word ‘surprise’ is too weak to describe the situation,” said the official, one of five Turkish source who spoke to Reuters about the Dec. 14 call between the two leaders. Trump’s decision wa also a shock in Washington, where senior administration officials, including Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, tried for day to change the president’s mind, U.S. official said. When Trump made clear he would not back down, Mattis and a senior official coordinating the fight against Islamic State, Brett McGurk, both resigned. On a visit to a U.S. air base in Iraq this week, Trump said that military commander had repeatedly requested extension for the 2,000 U.S. troop in Syria - request that he finally turned down because he said Islamic State wa largely beaten. “We’ve knocked them silly. I will tell you I’ve had some very good talk with President Erdogan who want to knock them out also, and he’ll do it,” he told American troops. For Turkey, Trump’s decision offer opportunity and risk. Ankara ha complained bitterly for year that the United States, a NATO ally, had chosen the Kurdish YPG militia a it main partner on the ground in Syria against Islamic State. Turkey say the YPG is a terrorist group, inseparable from the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) which ha waged an insurgency in southeast Turkey in which 40,000 people have been killed. The U.S. withdrawal potentially free Turkey’s military to push the YPG back from 500 km of border without risking a confrontation with American forces. It also remove a main cause of this year’s diplomatic crisis between the two countries. But it also open up an area of Syria far larger than anything Turkey had expected to fill, potentially pitting it against not just Kurdish force but also the Damascus government - which is committed to regaining control of all of Syria - and it Russian and Iranian backers. The YPG on Friday asked the Syrian government to take over the town of Manbij, which the Kurdish militia currently control with U.S. support, to protect it from Turkish attack. And if Turkish force are to take on Islamic State in it last pocket of Syrian territory near the Iraqi border, they would first have to cross 250 km of territory controlled by the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces. “Erdogan got more than he bargained for,” said Soner Cagaptay, Director of the Turkish Program at the Washington Institute. “He had asked the U.S. to drop the YPG, but not withdraw from Syria”. Erdogan ha for year backed rebel who once hoped to topple Bashar al-Assad, but the Syrian president’s survival ha been assured by support from Tehran and Moscow even though the north and east - including Syrian oilfield - remain beyond Assad’s control for now. As it take stock of the new challenge, Turkey is launching intensive talk with Washington and Moscow. Ankara expects U.S. military official to visit within days, a well a Bolton and possibly the U.S. special Syria envoy, James Jeffrey. Turkey’s intelligence chief and defence and foreign minister are also due in Moscow on Saturday, the spokesman for Erdogan’s AK Party said. “Of course it will be difficult. The whole issue need to be planned again from the start,” a Turkish security official said. A U.S. official said military planner were drafting plan that could see a withdrawal over the course of several months. One of the proposal under consideration is a 120-day withdrawal period, according a person familiar with discussions. Washington is also grappling with what to do with weapon it provided to the YPG militia and promised to take back after the campaign against Islamic State ended. Turkey say the weapon must be collected so they are not used against Turkish troops, but U.S. official say they cannot disarm their own ally when the fight is not yet over. Erdogan announced last week Turkey is postponing it planned military operation against the YPG in light of Trump’s decision. The Turkish military ha already carried out two incursion into north Syria, backed by pro-Turkey Syrian rebels. In 2016 they targeted Islamic State and Kurdish fighters, and earlier this year took control of the YPG-held Afrin region. But Ankara and it Syrian rebel ally alone do not have the capacity to take over the whole region which the United States is abandoning, Cagaptay said. Turkey’s priority therefore may be to secure it southern frontier. “Distancing the YPG from the border and wiping out these element is of critical importance,” the security official said. He stressed the need for careful coordination over who should fill other area which departing U.S. force will leave, and warned of problem ahead if agreement could not be reached. “Is it a big victory for Turkey?” another official said. “I’m not sure right now.” Additional reporting by Tulay Karadeniz in Ankara and Humeyra Pamuk and Idrees Ali in Washington; Editing by Dominic Evans and Angus MacSwan All quote delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

       " 'The Syrian army said it had deployed force to Manbij in northern Syria on Friday after the Kurdish YPG militia urged Damascus to protect the town, where U.S. force operate, from the threat of a major Turkish offensive. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, said the government force had entered a strip of territory at the edge of Manbij, not inside the town itself, creating a barrier with Turkey-backed fighter nearby. Manbij, which U.S.-backed force captured from Islamic State in 2016, ha emerged a a focal point of new tension after U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw U.S. force whose presence ha effectively deterred Turkey. After the Syrian army announcement, Turkey-backed Syrian rebel stationed in nearby territory said they had begun moving together with Turkish force towards the town in readiness for “the start of military operation to liberate” it. A witness said convoy of Turkey-backed insurgents, with armoured vehicle and machine guns, were moving towards the frontline with the town. Manbij, where U.S. troop have a military base, is held by a local militia allied to the YPG which Turkey deems a security threat. A U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told Reuters that U.S. troop had not changed their position in Manbij and dozen still remained. The official said they had not seen Syrian military force inside Manbij but rather on the outskirt of the city. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, who ha vowed to crush the YPG, said Turkish official would visit Russia - Assad’s most powerful ally - on Saturday and discus Syria. He indicated Turkey wa not in a hurry to launch an offensive. Trump’s abrupt decision to withdraw troop from Syria ha alarmed the Kurdish-led fighter who have fought Islamic State alongside them for years. Kurdish leader are scrambling for a strategy to protect their region stretching across the north and east, where the presence of some 2,000 U.S. troop ha so far deterred Turkey. A deployment of Syrian government forces, backed by Russia, would complicate any offensive by Turkey and it Syrian rebel proxies. U.S. military support for the Kurdish fighter ha infuriated Turkey, which see the YPG a an extension of the PKK movement that ha been waging an insurgency inside Turkey for decades. Syrian state medium circulated a video showing dozen of soldier marching on a countryside road, chanting for President Bashar al-Assad. The military statement said troop had raised the national flag in Manbij on Friday and would guarantee security “for all Syrian citizen and others present.” A resident inside the town said nothing had changed and he had not seen any such flags. The YPG said on Friday it fighter had withdrawn from Manbij before to fight Islamic State elsewhere. “We invite the Syrian government, to which we belong, a people, land and borders, to send it armed force to take over these position and protect Manbij in the face of Turkish threats,” it said. In November, Turkish and U.S. troop began joint patrol near Manbij after reaching a deal that includes the YPG exiting the town.',\n",

       " 'The United States is deeply concerned about an increase in coca cultivation in Colombia, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday, but will work with the Andean country to cut production of the raw material for cocaine in half by the end of 2023. Pompeo met with Colombian President Ivan Duque on a brief visit to the coastal city of Cartagena. “The United States remains deeply concerned about the surge in coca cultivation and cocaine production in Colombia since 2013,” Pompeo told journalist following the meeting. Colombia ha long been ranked a the world’s top producer of cocaine, for which coca is the base ingredient, but figure compiled by the United Nations for 2017 showed the largest potential output since the organisation began keeping records, with cocaine production at 1,379 metric tons. “We will continue to work with you Mr. President side-by-side to achieve our joint objective to cut coca cultivation and coca production by 50 percent between now and 2023,” Pompeo said. Colombia’s acreage of coca, the raw material for cocaine, expanded 17 percent to 171,000 hectare (422,550 acres) in 2017, according to the U.N. The uptick wa due to increased productivity and grower eager to expand in hope of getting more aid to switch to legal crops. The government want to eradicate 100,000 hectare of coca crop in 2019. Duque said last month that 2018 eradication would total more than 80,000 hectare of illicit crops. The U.S. commitment to helping Colombia dismantle organised crime group is “vital”, Duque said in his remarks. Aerial fumigation with the herbicide glyphosate, suspended in 2015 after being linked to cancer, may be reinstated if it can be made to comply with judicial conditions, Duque ha said. Duque and Pompeo also discussed the crisis in Venezuela, where hyperinflation and food and medicine shortage have spurred more than 3 million people to flee over the past several years, including more than a million who now live in Colombia. Pompeo commended Colombia for it support of Venezuelan migrant and said he and Duque discussed how to collaborate on aid with regional and international bodies. “All country that defend democracy, all country that share the value of democracy should unite to reject the Venezuelan dictatorship,” Duque said.

Trump did not provide a timetable for the planned military exit from Syria, which he announced last month against the advice of top national security aide and without consulting lawmaker or U.S. ally participating in anti-Islamic State operations. The decision prompted Defence Secretary Jim Mattis to resign. Trump said on Wednesday he had essentially fired Mattis, whose letter of resignation wa seen a a sharp rebuke to the Republican president. During a Cabinet meeting at the White House in front of reporters, Trump said he had never set a reported four-month timetable for the withdrawal of 2,000 American troop stationed in Syria amid a battle against Islamic State militants. “We’re getting out and we’re getting out smart,” Trump said. “I never said I’m getting out tomorrow.” He declined to be specific about how long troop would remain in Syria. In recent days, Trump appeared to back off from any hasty pullout and stressed that the operation would be slow. “We’re slowly sending our troop back home to be with their families, while at the same time fighting Isis [Islamic State] remnants,” he said on Twitter on Monday. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said he came out of a recent lunch with Trump feeling reassured about the Syria policy. Graham told reporter that Trump wa committed to making sure Turkey did not clash with the Kurdish YPG force once U.S. troop leave Syria, and wa assuring the NATO ally that it would have a buffer zone in the region to help protect it own interests. Turkey view the YPG a a branch of it own Kurdish separatist movement and is threatening to launch an offensive against the group, igniting fear of significant civilian casualties. U.S. commander planning the U.S. withdrawal are recommending that YPG fighter battling Islamic State be allowed to keep U.S.-supplied weapons, according to U.S. officials. That proposal would likely anger Turkey, where Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, is expected to hold talk in the coming days. Trump said he wa not happy that the Kurds were selling oil to Iran, but that he wanted to protect them either way. “I didn’t like the fact that they’re selling the small (amount of) oil that they have to Iran, and we asked them not to sell it to Iran... We’re not thrilled about that. OK? I’m not happy about it at all,” he said. “We want to protect the Kurds, nevertheless. We want to protect the Kurds, but I don’t want to be in Syria forever.

       " 'A shutdown of about a quarter of the U.S. government rolled into it 12th day on Wednesday, with lawmaker and President Donald Trump divided over his demand for money for a border wall. The shutdown, which began on Dec. 22, is the 19th to occur since the mid-1970s. Most have been brief. Trump’s latest is the third on the Republican president’s watch and already rank among the longest ever. A meeting on the shutdown at the White House with senior lawmaker wa scheduled for Wednesday afternoon. There were several very short shutdown under Republican President Ronald Reagan. Under Democratic President Bill Clinton, there were two shutdowns, including the longest on record: 21 day in 1996. A 16-day shutdown happened under Democratic President Barack Obama in 2013 in a fight with Republicans over his healthcare law. The current shutdown ha not affected three-quarters of the government, including the Department of Defence and the Postal Service, which have secure funding. But 800,000 employee from the department of Homeland Security and Transportation and other agency have been furloughed or are working without pay. Here is what is happening around the federal government. The Smithsonian museum and the National Zoo in Washington are closed due to the shutdown, according to the Smithsonian website. Among these is the popular National Museum of African American History and Culture, which opened in 2016. “The museum is closed due to the federal government shutdown. Timed entry pas holder will be emailed instruction on how to reschedule their visit,” the museum posted on Instagram. The department that oversees Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Transportation Security Administration, the Coast Guard and the Secret Service is affected. But most employee are “essential,” so they are working without pay until a funding bill is passed. Of 245,000 agency employees, nearly 213,000 have been deemed “essential,” according to the department’s contingency plan. Most of this department’s 7,500 employee are “non-essential;” only about 340 are working. Nearly 1,000 others may be called in for specific tasks, without pay. Public housing authority and Native American tribal housing entity are not part of the federal government and so are not required to shut down. But the federal government provides some of their funding, so they may need to reduce or change operating hours. HUD, which oversees some housing loan and low-income housing payment programs, warned in it contingency plan that “a protracted shutdown could see a decline in home sales, reversing the trend towards a strengthening market that we’ve been experiencing.” The Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Economic Analysis and Census Bureau are not publishing economic data, including key figure on gross domestic product, inflation, personal income, spending, trade and new home sales, during the shutdown. The agency that oversees the federal workforce ha given advice to worker on dealing with landlords, mortgage lender and other creditors, including sample letter explaining severe lost income due to the lack of federal funding. The FCC, which regulates radio and television broadcast and cable systems, said it will suspend most operation at midday on Thursday, if the shutdown ha not ended by then. Work for “the protection of life and property” will continue. So will operation at the agency’s Office of Inspector General, the FCC’s internal watchdog. Members of the Coast Guard were due to get their final 2018 paycheck on Monday, their last until the government reopens.

       " 'A decline in the number of mortgage approved by British high-street bank flattened out last month, with the first year-on-year rise since September 2017, figure from industry group UK Finance showed on Friday. Britain’s housing market ha slowed since the country voted to leave the European Union in June 2016, and other survey this month have shown anxiety among consumer and business ahead of the planned departure on March 29. Friday’s data showed British bank approved 39,403 mortgage for house purchase in November on a seasonally adjusted basis, down from 39,640 in October but up by 0.2 percent from November 2017 — the first annual rise in 14 months. “The housing market is struggling for momentum in the face of still relatively limited consumer purchasing power, fragile consumer confidence and, possibly, wariness over higher interest rates,” Howard Archer, chief economist at consultant EY ITEM Club, said. Many economist expect house price to be flat or marginally higher next year, a weakness in London and surrounding area weighs on faster price growth in other part of Britain, though the Bank of England ha said fall of a much a a third are possible if Brexit descends into chaos. Prime Minister Theresa May’s minority government plan to seek parliamentary approval for her Brexit deal in the week starting Jan. 14, after scrapping a vote before Christmas due to opposition from lawmaker of all parties. Without a deal, Britain face major economic disruption from the reintroduction of tariff and custom check at it borders.

Net lending to non-financial business fell by the most since May, dropping by 656 million pound ($829 million). “Overall lending to business ha remained subdued in this period of economic uncertainty,” UK Finance’s managing director for commercial finance, Stephen Pegge, said.

       " 'As move towards peace pick up in Afghanistan, the Taliban are trying to show they have changed since the brutal day of the 1990s when they banned music and girls’ education and carried out public execution in Kabul’s football stadium. “If peace come and the Taliban return, then our return will not be in the same harsh way a it wa in 1996,” Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid told Reuters, referring to the year they took over in Kabul before their ouster by U.S.-led troop in 2001. “We want to assure Afghan national that there will be no threat to anyone from our side.” The comment come a move towards peace negotiation have intensified, following a series of meeting between U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and Taliban representative over the past three months. Expectations of a decisive shift have been heightened by report that more than 5,000 U.S. troop may be withdrawn from Afghanistan, in an abrupt about-turn from the previous U.S. strategy of stepping up military pressure on the insurgents. “Our opposition is with the presence of foreign troop in Afghanistan. Once they are out and a peace deal is reached, then a nationwide amnesty will be announced,” said Mujahid. “No one, police, army, government employee or anyone, will face revenge behaviour from our side.” Reports of the withdrawal are unconfirmed but they have triggered alarm among many Afghans with bitter memory of the Taliban’s ultra-hardline regime. “I don’t think their mindset ha changed but they have realised that without respecting human rights, they cannot be accepted by the international community,” said Bilal Sediqi, spokesman for the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission. With Afghanistan likely to remain dependent on foreign aid for years, the Taliban know they cannot return to the past when fighter swept into Kabul after the chaos of the 1990s civil war. But they insist that a well a the withdrawal of foreign forces, there will be a return to their strict version of Islamic rule and many Afghans doubt their claim to have softened, even while yearning for an end to the war. In June, Taliban leader were angry at their fighter swapping selfies with soldier and government official and eating ice cream with civilian during a three-day ceasefire. Soon afterwards, they launched complex attack on strategic province to try to oust Afghan force and used civilian a human shields. “I know there is no place for me if the Taliban return in their old style,” said Abdul, a 12-year police veteran currently working in the western province of Farah. “...I will stand by the government side whatever it decides. But still I have not lost my hope in the future. The Taliban are not the old ones. We see change among them. They are also tired of war.” The Taliban, a predominantly ethnic Pashtun movement, strongest in the south and east of the country, now control large stretch of the countryside, where they levy taxes, run court and control education. For many conservative rural Afghans, Taliban rule provides welcome stability and the merciless punishment and rigid control on women’s right fit well with traditional practice in many areas. In the Aqtash district of northern Kunduz province, a hotbed of Taliban insurgents, some woman said they are allowed to walk freely and do not have to cover their face in all-enveloping burqas. Mujahid said the Taliban were not against women’s education or employment but wanted to maintain cultural and religious codes. “We are not against woman working in government organisation or against their outdoor activities, but we will be against the alien culture clothes worn by women, brought to our country,” Mujahid said. Omaid Maisam, the deputy spokesman for Afghan Chief Executive officer Abdullah Abdullah, said the government protects human right and the Taliban must accept the national constitution to shed their hardline image. “We have seen some sign of change among them, but they have to show it in their action that they have really changed,” he said. Many believe the return on the Taliban would threaten the gain the country ha made since 2001. Much work remains to be done to convince woman in work or education and sceptical group of ethnic Tajiks, Uzbeks and Hazaras from northern and central Afghanistan. “I think that these statement that the Taliban have changed are only excuse that are being used by the Taliban to gain acceptance,” said Malina Hamidi, a teacher at a school in the Chamtal district of Balkh province. “I am 100 percent confident that once they come back to power, they will be the same Taliban that ruled Afghanistan in the nineties.” Additional reporting by Abdul Matin Sahak in MAZAR-I SHARIF; Writing by Rupam Jain in Kabul; Editing by Nick Macfie All quote delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

       " 'Brazil’s newly inaugurated President Jair Bolsonaro said on Tuesday his election had freed the country from “socialism and political correctness,” and he vowed to tackle corruption, crime and economic mismanagement in Latin America’s largest nation. Bolsonaro, a former army captain turned lawmaker who openly admires Brazil’s 1964-1985 military dictatorship, promised in his first remark a president to adhere to democratic norms, after his tirade against the medium and political opponent had stirred unease. While investor hope Bolsonaro’s free-market stance will reinvigorate Brazil’s economy - the eight largest in the world - environmentalist and right group are worried he will roll back protection for the Amazon rain forest and loosen gun control in a country that already ha the world’s highest number of murders. “This is the beginning of Brazil’s liberation from socialism, political correctness and a bloated state,” Bolsonaro, 63, said in an address to the nation made after he donned the presidential sash. A seven-term congressman who spent decade on the fringe of Brazilian politics, Bolsonaro wa swept to power in October by voters’ outrage with traditional political parties, making him Brazil’s first right-wing president since the dictatorship. Voters punished mainstream party following more than four year of graft investigation that laid bare the largest political corruption scheme ever discovered. Centrist party were trounced, reshaping Brazil’s political landscape and polarizing Congress. Following a knife attack during the presidential campaign that left Bolsonaro hospitalized for weeks, security wa tight for his inauguration. Some 10,000 police officer and soldier were deployed on the street of Brasilia, the capital, a Bolsonaro and his wife rode in an open-topped Rolls-Royce to Congress. His voter are now impatient for Bolsonaro to make good on ambitious promise to tackle graft and violent crime and revive an economy still sputtering after the collapse of a commodity boom led to Brazil’s worst recession on record. As thousand of supporters, many with the Brazilian flag draped around their shoulders, chanted “the captain ha arrived!,” Bolsonaro launched into a fiery speech. “We have the great challenge of taking on the effect of an economic crisis, of facing the distortion of human right and the breakdown of the family,” he said. “We must urgently end ideology that defend criminal and penalise police.” Bolsonaro, who wa sworn in before a joint session of Congress, called on lawmaker to help him “free the nation definitively from the yoke of corruption, crime, economic irresponsibility and ideological submission.” On the economic front, the new leader promised to open foreign market for Brazil and enact reform to reduce a yawning budget deficit, putting government account on a sustainable path. Bolsonaro plan to realign Brazil internationally, moving away from developing-nation ally and closer to the policy of Western leaders, particularly U.S. President Donald Trump, who sent Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to his inauguration. Trump congratulated Bolsonaro in a Twitter message, writing “The USA is with you”. As a clear sign of that diplomatic shift, Bolsonaro plan to move the Brazilian embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, breaking with Brazil’s traditional support for a two-state solution to the Palestinian issue. Backed massively by conservative sector of Brazil, including Christian evangelical churches, Bolsonaro would block move to legalize abortion beyond even the current limited exception and remove sex education from public schools, opposing what he call “cultural Marxism” introduced by recent leftist governments. One-third of his Cabinet are former army officers, mostly fellow cadet at the Black Needles academy, Brazil’s West Point, all outspoken backer of the former military regime. Bolsonaro ha faced charge of inciting rape and for hate crime because of comment about women, gay and racial minorities. Yet his law-and-order rhetoric and plan to ease gun control have resonated with many voters, especially in Brazil’s booming farm country. In an interview with Record TV on the eve of his inauguration, Bolsonaro lashed out at Brazil’s notorious bureaucracy, which make doing business difficult and expensive. He vowed to strip away the so-called “Brazil Cost” that hamstring private enterprise. “The government machine is really heavy,” he said. “There are hundred of bureaucratic governing body across Brazil, of regulator a well. ... We have to untangle the mess.” Bolsonaro’s vow to follow Trump’s example and pull Brazil out of the Paris climate change agreement ha worried environmentalists. So have his plan to build hydroelectric dam in the Amazon and open up to mining the reservation of indigenous people who are seen a the last custodian of the world’s biggest forest. Brazilian business are eager to see Bolsonaro take office and install a team of orthodox economist led by investment banker Paulo Guedes, who ha promised quick action in bringing Brazil’s unsustainable budget deficit under control. Guedes plan to sell a many state company a possible in a privatisation drive that he forecast could eventually bring in up to 1 trillion reais (202.3 billion pounds) That would help restore order to government finances. The key measure, however, for reducing the deficit and stopping a dangerous rise of Brazil’s public debt will be the overhaul of the costly social security system. Pension reform will be Bolsonaro’s biggest challenge since he ha yet to build a base in Congress, where he ha eschewed the political horse-trading that traditionally helped Brazilian president govern the nation of nearly 210 million people.',\n",
       " 'Algeria ha barred all Syrians from entering the country via it southern border with Mali and Niger to keep out member of defeated rebel group from Syria deemed to pose a security risk, a senior official said on Wednesday. Hassen Kacimi, the official in charge of migrant policy at the interior ministry, told Reuters that Syrians seeking refuge in Algeria in this way were suspected to be Islamist militant and were not welcome. Algeria went through year of devastating civil war with hardcore jihadist group in the 1990s. While violence is now greatly diminished, sporadic attack continue in isolated areas. “We have hosted 50,000 Syrians in the past few year for humanitarian reasons,” Kacimi said, alluding to refugee from Syria’s civil war, “but we cannot accept member of armed group fleeing from Syria when it come to our security.” He said around 100 had reached the southern border with the help of local armed escort in recent week but were intercepted and expelled shortly after they slipped into Algeria. Kacimi said these Syrians had transited Turkey, Jordan, Egypt, Sudan and Niger or Mali using fake Sudanese passports. “Definitely this is a criminal network and we must be very vigilant not to allow them get into Algeria,” he said. Algeria ha kept diplomatic relation with Syria throughout it own civil war, in which President Bashar al-Assad ha largely defeated rebel and jihadist trying to topple him. Syrians do not need visa to enter Algeria. Algeria’s south and southeast are largely empty desert region but it ha beefed up it security presence there after neighbouring Libya and northern Mali and Niger fell into the hand of various militant and rebel factions. Since it 1990s civil war, Algeria ha become an important U.S. ally against Islamist militant active in the arid Sahel region of north and west Africa.',\n",
       " 'Somalia ha kicked out the country’s top United Nations official in a decision likely to harm relation with foreign power backing government attempt to restore stability after decade of turmoil. The government accused Nicholas Haysom, Special Representative of U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, of interfering with internal affairs. The United Nations is a major backer of Somalia, a country that ha lacked strong central government since 1991. The government’s decision over Haysom could intensify a confrontation between Mogadishu and the semi-autonomous regions. Haysom raised question in a Dec. 30 letter about the involvement of U.N.-supported Somali security force in the arrest of a former militant of the Islamist al Shabaab group who wa blocked from running in a recent regional election. Haysom “is not required and cannot work in this country”, the foreign affair ministry said. “He openly breached the appropriate conduct of the U.N. office in Somalia,” said the statement late on Tuesday, which effectively make the South African persona non grata. The United Nations is looking into the matter, U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq told reporter in New York on Wednesday. “We’re trying to get the various detail corroborated and we’re going to see, based on that, what further step are needed,” Haq said. He said Haysom wa due to brief the U.N. Security Council on Thursday - a previously scheduled - on the U.N. mission in Somalia, which also support an African Union peacekeeping force fighting al Shabaab. Haysom wa also due to meet with Guterres. Haysom’s letter to Somalia’s interior security minister expressed concern over the government’s handling of the arrest of former Shabaab leader Mukhtar Robow and subsequent unrest last month. At least 15 civilian were killed and around 300 people detained, most of them children, when protest erupted after Robow’s arrest in the southern city of Baidoa, according to the U.N. letter. The government said Robow wa arrested on suspicion that he had brought militant and weapon back to Baidoa, the capital of South West region where he tried to contest for president in last month’s election. His arrest sparked clash between militiaman loyal to Robow and Somali forces. Ethiopian security forces, who are part of an African Union peacekeeping force, were also involved. Al Shabaab ha sought for over a decade to topple the central government and implement it strict version of Islamic law. It wa driven out of the capital in 2011 but maintains a foothold in some region including South West. Robow renounced violence and recognised federal authority in 2017. In the letter, Haysom asked the minister to explain the legal basis for Robow’s arrest. He also asked what action had been taken to investigate the death during the demonstration in Baidoa following the arrest. The U.N. letter also contained an annexed letter from the European Union, Germany and Britain announcing the suspension of their support to the police in South West state due to their conduct during last month’s election. Haysom also detailed the U.N. support to the Somali police force and the South West regional police which includes the payment of stipend to the police.

Sudan ha been rocked by near-daily demonstration over the past two weeks. Protesters have set alight ruling party building and have called on President Omar al-Bashir, who took power in 1989, to step down. In a country where the state tightly control traditional media, the internet ha become a key information battleground.

But the head of Sudan’s National Intelligence and Security Service, Salah Abdallah, told a rare news conference on Dec. 21: “There wa a discussion in the government about blocking social medium site and in the end it wa decided to block them.” Users of the three main telecommunication operator in the country — Zain, MTN and Sudani — said access to Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp ha only been possible through use of a virtual private network (VPN). Though VPNs can bring their own connection problem and some Sudanese are unaware of their existence, activist have used them widely to organise and document the demonstrations. Hashtags in Arabic such a “Sudan’s_cities_revolt” have been widely circulated from Sudan and abroad. Hashtags in English such a #SudanRevolts have also been used. “Social medium ha a really big impact, and it help with forming public opinion and transmitting what’s happening in Sudan to the outside,” said Mujtaba Musa, a Sudanese Twitter user with over 50,000 follower who ha been active in documenting the protests.

       " 'Scientists have found that a strain of cholera causing an epidemic in Yemen – the worst in recorded history – came from eastern Africa and wa probably borne into Yemen by migrants. Using genomic sequencing techniques, researcher at Britain’s Wellcome Sanger Institute and France’s Institut Pasteur also said they should now be better able to estimate the risk of future cholera outbreak in region like Yemen, giving health authority more time to intervene. “Knowing how cholera move globally give u the opportunity to better prepare for future outbreaks,” said Nick Thomson, a professor at Sanger and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine who co-led the work. Nearly four year of war between a Saudi-led coalition and the Iranian-aligned Houthi group have crippled healthcare and sanitation system in Yemen, where some 1.2 million suspected cholera case have been reported since 2017, with 2,515 deaths. The World Health Organization (WHO) warned in October that the outbreak is accelerating again with roughly 10,000 suspected case now reported per week, double the average rate for the first eight month of 2018. To explore the origin of the outbreak, Sanger and Pasteur team sequenced the genome of cholera bacteria sample collected in Yemen and nearby areas. They included sample from a Yemeni refugee center on the Saudi Arabia-Yemen border and 74 other cholera sample from South Asia, the Middle East and eastern and central Africa. The team, whose finding were published in the journal Nature on Wednesday, then compared these sequence to a global collection of more than 1,000 cholera sample and found that the strain causing the Yemen epidemic is related to one first seen in 2012 in South Asia that ha spread globally. However, the Yemeni strain did not arrive directly from South Asia, the scientist found, but wa circulating and causing outbreak in eastern Africa in 2013-14, prior to appearing in Yemen in 2016. “Genomics enabled u to discover that the strain of cholera behind the devastating and ongoing epidemic in Yemen is likely linked to the migration of people from eastern Africa into Yemen,” said Thomson. He added, however, that from the sample available, the team wa not able to pinpoint exactly which country in eastern Africa the strain had come from.',\n",

They discussed “supporting the people of Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua in restoring democratic governance and their human rights,” State Department deputy spokesman Robert Palladino said. Pompeo later met with Bolsonaro and also broached the question of “reinforcing democratic governance and human rights” in those three countries. Speaking to reporter in Brasilia, Pompeo said Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua were country that do not share the democratic value that unite the United States and Brazil. “We have an opportunity to work alongside each other against authoritarian regimes,” he said at a news conference. In response, Venezuela’s foreign ministry said in a statement it “categorically rejected” Pompeo’s “interventionist attitude,” accusing him of seeking to rally support among Latin American country for “forcible regime change” in Venezuela. Cuban Communist Party leader Raul Castro on Tuesday blasted the Trump administration for returning to an outdated path of confrontation with his island nation and of intervening in Latin America, in a speech marking the 60th anniversary of Cuba’s revolution. Pompeo gave no detail of how Washington plan to step up pressure for democratic change in Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua. He did not address a reporter’s question on whether military intervention would be an option.

       " 'Two woman defied a centuries-old ban on entering a Hindu temple in the Indian state of Kerala on Wednesday, sparking protest and call for a strike by conservative Hindu group outraged by their visit. Police fired teargas and used water cannon to disperse a large crowd of protester in the state capital of Thiruvananthapuram, television news channel showed. There were protest in several other city in the state, medium reported. India’s Supreme Court in September ordered the lifting of the ban on woman or girl of menstruating age from entering the Sabarimala temple, which draw million of worshipper a year. But the temple refused to abide by the ruling and subsequent attempt by woman to visit it had been blocked by thousand of devotees. The Kerala state government is run by left-wing party and it ha sought to allow woman into the temple - a position that ha drawn the criticism of both of India’s main political parties, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The uproar ha put the issue of religion, which can be highly contentious in India, squarely on the political agenda month before a general election, which is due by May. The possibility of more confrontation wa raised by a call from an umbrella group of right-wing Hindu group in Kerala, the Sabarimala Karma Samithi, which is supported by the BJP, for a state-wide protest strike on Thursday. The BJP called for protester to be peaceful. Earlier, the Kerala state president of the BJP described the women’s visit a “a conspiracy by the atheist ruler to destroy the Hindu temples”. The party’s state president, P.S Sreedharan Pillai, told TV channel the BJP would “support the struggle against the destruction of faith by the Communists”. “Let all the devotee come forward and protest this,” he said. Officials from the main opposition Congress party in the state, in a rare alignment with their main rival for power at the national level, the BJP, also called for protests. “This is treachery ... The government will have to pay the price for the violation of the custom,” K. Sudhakaran, vice-president of the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee, said in a statement. Conservative Hindu group say they believe woman of menstruating age would defile the temple’s inner shrine. The ban wa imposed on all female between the age of 10 and 50. News channel reported the chief priest briefly shut the temple for “purification” ritual after the woman visited. Later, medium reported it had re-opened. The two women, identified by police a Bindu Ammini, 42, and Kanaka Durga, 44, had tried to go in on Dec. 24, and later approached police for help, an officer said. “There wa an elaborate arrangement for them to come just after the temple wa opened early morning,” said the officer, who declined to be identified fearing reprisal from protesters. “The darkness gave them, and us, cover.” Police were guarding the home of the woman after they left the temple and were prepared to let more woman enter the temple, he said. A video from a police official posted online by ANI showed two woman in the temple with their head covered. Ammini told a television channel about their stealthy trek to the temple in the middle of the night. “We reached Pampa, the main entry point to the temple at 1.30 a.m. and sought police protection ... We walked two hours, entered the temple around 3.30 a.m. and did the darshan,” the woman said, referring to a ritual of standing in front of the temple’s Hindu image. The state government defended it decision to protect the woman a they went into the temple, saying it wa a matter of civil rights. “I had earlier made it clear that the government will provide protection if any woman come forward to enter the temple,” said Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan. Vijayan told a news conference the woman faced no obstruction on Wednesday. It wa not immediately clear how they managed to avoid devotee guarding the temple. On Tuesday, the state government backed a protest by thousand of women, who formed a 620 km (385 mile) human chain, termed the “women’s wall”, in support of “gender equality” and access to the temple.

       " 'President Donald Trump made a surprise Christmas visit to U.S. troop in Iraq on Wednesday, his first trip to a conflict zone nearly two year into his presidency and day after announcing a pullout of American troop from neighbouring Syria. Trump wa looking for some positive headline after several day of turmoil over his decision to withdraw the 2,000 U.S. troop in Syria, pull out half of the 14,000-strong contingent in Afghanistan, and push out Defence Secretary James Mattis two month earlier than planned for criticizing his policies. Accompanied by first lady Melania Trump and speaking at the Al Asad Air Base west of Baghdad, Trump defended the withdrawal from Syria and said it wa made possible by the defeat of Islamic State militants. “Our presence in Syria wa not open ended and it wa never intended to be permanent,” he told troop wearing camouflage fatigue in a hangar at the base. He said some troop “can now return home to their families.” Many Republican and Democratic lawmaker have heaped scorn on Trump over his Syria policy, saying the fight against Islamic State is far from over and the withdrawal leaf ally in the lurch. One of those critic wa Mattis, who said in a candid resignation letter last week that his view did not align with Trump’s, particularly on the treatment of U.S. allies. Mattis had planned to leave at the end of February, but Trump forced him to go on Jan. 1 after his resignation letter wa made public. Trump ha also drawn fire from some in the U.S. military for not having visited U.S. troop in conflict zone since taking office in January 2017, particularly after he cancelled a trip to a World War One cemetery in France last month due to rain. While there ha been no full-scale violence in Iraq since Islamic State suffered a series of defeat last year, some 5,200 U.S. troop train and advise Iraqi force still waging a campaign against the militant group. Trump spent a little more than three hour in Iraq. On his way home, he stopped for about an hour and a half at Ramstein Air Base in Germany, where he shook hand and posed for picture with some of the hundred of troop lined up inside a hangar. After Ramstein, Trump headed back to Washington. Trump wa supposed to meet with Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi but in the end they only spoke by telephone. Abdul Mahdi’s office said there wa “a disagreement over how to conduct the meeting.” Iraqi lawmaker said the prime minister declined Trump’s request to meet him at the military base. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said the meeting could not be arranged due to security concern and the short notice of the trip, but she said they had a “great call” and that Abdul Mahdi accepted Trump’s invitation to the White House in the New Year. The unannounced visit in Iraq followed in the footstep of two of Trump’s predecessors, Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Barack Obama, who both made surprise trip to see troops. For security reasons, the visit are usually kept secret until after the president arrives. A small group of aide and Secret Service agents, and a pool of reporters, were with Trump and the first lady on the overnight flight from Washington. Trump said his main security concern wa for the first lady. While in Iraq, Trump also spoke to military commander and the U.S. ambassador. Sanders said they “came up with a powerful plan that will allow u to continue our path to total victory” over Islamic State. Unlike Syria, Trump said he had no plan to withdraw from Iraq. Trump ha had an uneven relationship with America’s military. He did not have to serve during the Vietnam War after being diagnosed with bone spur in his heels. As president-elect, Trump wa drawn to the brawn of the armed force and stacked his first Cabinet with generals, many of whom have since left his administration. Trump ha also wanted to end protracted U.S. involvement in overseas conflicts, and to force ally to pay more of the cost that he say fall disproportionately on American taxpayers, a point he made again on Wednesday. Trump spoke to troop gathered in a dining hall festooned with holiday decoration and teased soldier about their favourite football teams. To reporters, he lamented the wear and tear of overseas conflicts. “It’s time to get our young people out,” Trump said. “And I’ve been signing plenty of letter and I don’t like sending those letter home to parent saying that your young man or your young woman ha been killed. “I don’t like doing it. We’ve been doing it long enough.”',\n",

The train with 131 passenger on board wa heading towards the capital, Copenhagen, when it hit the trailer. Apart from the dead, 16 people were injured but were not in critical condition, police said. The accident happened shortly before 7.35 a.m. (0635 GMT) during a severe storm that hampered the rescue operation on the 18-km (11-mile) Great Belt Bridge between Zealand and Funen, Denmark’s two major islands. “This morning’s tragic accident on the Great Belt Bridge with many killed and wounded ha shaken u all,” Danish Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen tweeted. “Ordinary Danes on their way to work or on the way home from Christmas holiday have had their life shattered.” A preliminary investigation by the Danish Accident Investigation Board showed a trailer had blown off a freight wagon onto the oncoming tracks, a spokesman said. “There wa a very, very loud bang and then the train stopped,” a witness who had been onboard the train with his daughter told broadcaster TV2. Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Löfven blamed the weather. “Terrible train accident on the Great Belt Bridge in Denmark a a result of the storm Alfrida. Our thought are with the injured and with the family and relative of the dead,” he tweeted. TV footage showed a severely damaged freight trailer adorned with the logo of Danish beer maker Carlsberg. Crates of beer could be seen inside. A train operated by DB Cargo, the logistics arm of Germany’s Deutsche Bahn which carry good from Carlsberg’s Fredericia brewery to Copenhagen, wa involved in the accident, a Carlsberg spokesman said. DB Cargo wa on site and “doing it utmost to support the investigation”, Deutsche Bahn said in a statement. A spokesman said the trailer were fastened to the railcar with metal rods, a system in use across Europe. The bridge remained closed for train while car traffic in both direction resumed. Danish rail operator Banedanmark said it did not expect rail traffic by to resume before Thursday. The Great Belt, part of a route that link Denmark and Sweden to Germany, carry around 21,000 train passenger and more than 27,000 vehicle each day.

       " 'Five Yemeni hip-hop dancer thought their problem had ended when the Islamist militant who had banned them from performing were defeated in the port city of Mukalla nearly three year ago by force backed by the United Arab Emirates. But last month Yemeni security force briefly detained the five member of the WaxOn band, broke their equipment and only released the dancer after they had signed a document saying they would stop dancing hip-hop in public. “The police said it wa a religious sin,” band member Salman Basuad said. Another band member, Mohammed Al Ameeri, said: “The officer were very violent.. They treated u a if we were terrorists.” Local security force did not respond immediately to Reuters’ request for comment. WaxOn band leader Mohammed Basaud said the ban reminded him of the “al Qaeda era” when the dancer were also barred from performing in public. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) ran a mini-state in the southern port city of Mukalla in 2015-16 before being defeated by force backed by a Saudi-led coalition, which intervened in Yemen’s civil war to restore it ousted president, Abd-Rabu Mansour Hadi. Since AQAP wa driven out, Mukalla ha been largely peaceful compared to the rest of Yemen, which ha been devastated by nearly four year of fighting between the Saudi-led coalition and the Iran-aligned Houthis. WaxOn, formed in 2014, resumed their public performance in 2016, dancing at graduation and birthday party among other events. Yemenis like coming to the main square of Mukalla to watch the street performer for free. Basaud, said Mukalla’s resident accepted WaxOn and would offer them money to perform, allowing them sometimes to make a much a 40,000 Yemen rial (£127) for a 10-minute performance. He said the security force had not moved against other band performing traditional Yemeni dance on the square. “We just want the security force to accept our position.. Our equipment and other thing were damaged and lost. If they will not compensate us, at least they should cancel those unnecessary pledge they took from u (not to dance),” he said.',\n",
       " 'A convoy of Syrian Kurdish fighter ha pulled out of the flashpoint area of Manbij in northern Syria, close to territory controlled by Turkey, Syria’s defence ministry said on Wednesday. Some 30 km (20 miles) from the Turkish border, the town occupies a critical spot on the map of the Syrian conflict, near the junction of three separate block of territory that form sphere of Russian, Turkish and - for now - U.S. influence. “According to information, approximately 400 Kurdish fighter have left Manbij so far,” the Syrian defence ministry said. Their departure wa in line with an agreement “for the return of normal life to the area of northern Syria,” it said. The ministry showed online a video of dozen of vehicle travelling along an unmade road carrying armed fighters, some waving the flag of the Kurdish-led People’s Protection Units (YPG) militia and it female counterpart the YPJ. The YPG is the strongest element in the Syrian Defence Forces (SDF), a coalition of militia that the United States ha backed in it campaign against Islamic State, helping it capture swathe of north and east Syria. Fearing an attack by Turkey after a U.S. pull-out from Syria, the YPG asked Syrian government force to deploy in the area around Manbij. There wa no immediate comment from the YPG or the SDF on the withdrawal or on how many fighter might remain in Manbij. Turkey regard the YPG a a terrorist group tied to the PKK inside it own borders, and ha staged incursion into Syria in support of Syrian rebel to push it from the Turkish frontier. As a result of one of those incursions, Turkish-backed force have held an area bordering Manbij since 2016, and Ankara ha repeatedly demanded that the YPG leave the area and cross to the east bank of the Euphrates. The YPG previously announced it had pulled it force out of Manbij and ha said fighter still in the area belonged to a local militia allied to the SDF. U.S. force have underpinned stability in Manbij since Islamic State’s defeat there in 2016, and have conducted joint patrol with Turkish force since November in an effort to allay Ankara’s security concerns.

       " 'Hindu nationalist linked to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ruling party urged him on Wednesday to push through law to allow the building of a temple on the ruin of a 16th century mosque, a flashpoint in tension with minority Muslims. A long-running dispute over the site in the northern town of Ayodhya ha flared back into life in recent month in the build-up to national election due before May. The Supreme Court is weighing petition from both community on what should be built there and Modi told Reuters partner ANI on Tuesday that the judicial process should take it course. A day later, Alok Kumar, the international working president of Vishva Hindu Parishad, responded: “The Supreme Court is taking it own sweet time and Hindus can’t wait endlessly to see a temple there.” “We’ll persuade the government of Prime Minister Modi to issue legislation to start the process of a grand temple in Ayodhya,” he told journalists. He wanted the legislation in place before the government’s term ends, he added. A Hindu crowd tore down the mosque in 1992, triggering riot that killed about 2,000 people across India, in one of the worst instance of communal violence since the partition of the country in 1947. Vishva Hindu Parishad, also known a the World Hindu Council, ha been spearheading a campaign over the past three decade to build a temple on the site of what Hindus say is the birthplace of Lord Ram, one of their most revered deities. Over the past few months, the group allied to Modi’s nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party ha organised rally of ten of thousand of activists, monk and other supporters, at a time of growing political and cultural tensions.

In a decision late Monday, U.S. Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler in San Francisco said the attack, which killed 14 people and injured 22 others, wa not the direct result of the companies’ alleged providing of resource to Islamic State. “A contrary conclusion pose boundless litigation risk and is not tenable given how interconnected communication service are with modern economic and social life,” the judge wrote. Beeler also found no liability for aiding and abetting terrorism under the 2016 Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA), finding allegation only that the company were “generally aware” that Islamic State used their services. The plaintiff included victim and relative of victim of the Dec. 2, 2015 attack at a government building by Syed Farook, 28, a U.S.-born son of Pakistani immigrants, and his wife Tashfeen Malik, 29, a native of Pakistan. Authorities have said the couple wa inspired by Islamist militants. Both died soon after the attack in a police shootout. Islamic State said Farook and Malik were two of it followers. Beeler dismissed the lawsuit with prejudice, meaning they cannot be filed again, citing other courts’ rejection of similar claim in other cases. Federal law give internet company broad immunity from liability for content posted by users. Keith Altman, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, on Wednesday said the decision wa “not a surprise,” and that issue including the impact of JASTA and what constitutes direct liability should be addressed at the appellate level.

The episode of the news-comedy program in question criticized the country over the killing of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi last year at the kingdom’s consulate in Turkey. Amnesty International denounced “Saudi Arabia’s censorship of Netflix” a “further proof of a relentless crackdown on freedom of expression”. Khashoggi had been an outspoken critic of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the country’s de facto ruler. The kingdom ha since acknowledged publicly that the columnist, who wa a permanent U.S. resident, died in it custody. “We strongly support artistic freedom worldwide and removed this episode only in Saudi Arabia after we had received a valid legal demand from the government — and to comply with local law,” a Netflix spokesperson said. “This demand wa consistent with Saudi law and so we have removed it in Saudi only,” the spokesperson said, adding that the move “doesn’t mean we agree with these laws”. Saudi official were not immediately available for comment. In the episode, first aired in the United States in October, Minhaj said, “Now would be a good time to reassess our relationship with Saudi Arabia. And I mean that a a Muslim and a an American.” He also criticized the kingdom for it involvement in the Yemen war and described it a being autocratic. The Netflix spokesperson added that the Saudi government had not asked the company to remove the clip from YouTube, and it had not done so. “The authority have previously used anti cyber-crime law to silence dissidents, creating an environment of fear for those who dare to speak up in Saudi Arabia,” Amnesty’s Middle East director of campaign Samah Hadid said. “By bowing to the Saudi Arabian authorities’ demands, Netflix is in danger of facilitating the Kingdom’s zero-tolerance policy on freedom of expression and assisting the authority in denying people’s right to freely access information,” Hadid said in a statement.',\n",

       " 'The number of British shopper hitting the post-Christmas sale dipped by 4.2 percent year-on-year on Wednesday, offering no relief for struggling store that had already discounted heavily to encourage spending in the run-up to the holiday. Out-of-town store and shopping centre were hit harder than town and cities, but visit to both fell for the third year in a row, according to data for the first hour of trading on the morning after Christmas. Shopping centre visit were down 6.7 percent by midday, market research firm Springboard said, while traditional town and city shopping street saw a 2.8 percent drop. Britain’s retailer had been hoping Christmas would revive spending after a bleak year for much of the sector that ha seen a string of chain go out of business or announce shop closures. The sector ha faced uncertainty over Britain’s exit from the European Union, rising labour cost and higher business property tax a well a unseasonably warm weather. Stores were pinning hope on a surge in shopper seeking bargain to counter poor trading in November and early December. Clothing chain such a Primark (ABF.L), Superdry (SDRY.L) and online retailer ASOS (ASOS.L) warned of weak sale earlier in December, after what Sports Direct (SPD.L) owner Mike Ashley said wa “the worst November in living memory” for retailers. Springboard said one reason for the drop in footfall wa the almost continuous discounting, particularly since November’s Black Friday. “However, many retailer offer greater discount online than in store, which discourages shopper to visit retail destination and brick and mortar stores,” Springboard said. Springboard said many people were eating and drinking a well a visiting shops, a trend that wa benefiting high streets, where there were more restaurant and other venues, more than retail parks.

       " 'Government and security official must “up their game” to tackle the illegal use of drone at airport which brought chaos to London’s Gatwick airport in the run-up to Christmas, Britain’s most senior police officer said on Thursday. Three day of drone sighting at Britain’s second busiest airport lead to about 1,000 flight cancellation and disrupted the travel of 140,000 passenger in what is thought to be the most disruptive incident of it kind. London’s Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick said no police force around the world could be sure of preventing the problem posed by drone at airports. “I think the whole country and certainly the government will have watched what’s gone on and said we need to up our game here,” Dick told BBC radio. “You won’t find a police service in the world I think who would be sitting complacently thinking: ‘well we could always deal with a drone’.” The drone were first spotted at Gatwick on Dec. 19. Every time the airport sought to reopen the runway, the drone returned and authority only regained control over the airfield after the army deployed military technology to guard the area. Security Minister Ben Wallace said on Monday that Britain’s security force now had detection system that could be deployed across the country to combat the drone threat. “The drone technology is always changing. We have to keep up with that. There are a whole variety of tactic and technology that we are now using, can use and in the future they will have to change again I’m sure,” said Dick. “I’ve been talking to colleague around the world. I can tell you this is not an easy problem. We are doing our very best here and going into the future I’m sure working closely with others we will get better and better.” The police investigation into the Gatwick incident is ongoing. Detectives on Sunday released without charge two people they had suspected of flying the drones. Flying drone within 1 km (0.6 mile) of a British airport boundary is punishable by up to five year in prison. “We need to work even more closely with the private companies, we need to work even more closely with the military, we need to try to be able to prevent the criminal use of drone for whatever motivation near our airports,” Dick said.',\n",
       " 'China reserve the right to use force to bring Taiwan under it control but will strive to achieve peaceful “reunification” with the self-ruled island that ha a bright future under any future Chinese rule, President Xi Jinping said on Wednesday. Taiwan is China’s most sensitive issue and is claimed by Beijing a it sacred territory. Xi ha stepped up pressure on the democratic island since Tsai Ing-wen from the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party became president in 2016. Tsai rejected Xi’s call and instead urged China to embrace democracy. Xi ha set great personal store in resolving what the Communist Party call the “Taiwan issue”, holding a landmark meeting with then Taiwan president Ma Ying-jeou in Singapore in late 2015, just before Tsai wa elected. Xi spoke at Beijing’s Great Hall of the People on the 40th anniversary of a landmark Taiwan policy statement. He said “reunification” must come under a one-China principle that accepts Taiwan a part of China, anathema to supporter of Taiwan independence, adding that the “one country, two systems” model of autonomy, with which China governs Hong Kong, wa the best way for Taiwan. China translates the word “tong yi” a “reunification”, but it can also be translated a “unification”, a term in English preferred by supporter of Taiwan independence who point out the Communist government ha never ruled Taiwan and so it cannot be “reunified”. The vast majority of Taiwan’s people are clearly aware that Taiwan independence would lead to a “grave disaster”, Xi told an audience that included Taiwan business people and senior party officials. “Chinese people don’t attack other Chinese people. We are willing to use the greatest sincerity and expend the greatest hard work to strive for the prospect of peaceful reunification,” Xi said. “We do not promise to renounce the use of force and reserve the option to use all necessary measures” to achieve this goal and prevent Taiwan independence, he said. This, though, wa aimed at foreign force who sought to interfere and the tiny minority of Taiwan independence force and their activities, Xi said without elaborating in what wa likely a reference to the United States, Taiwan’s strongest backer. Speaking to reporters, Tsai said Taiwan would never accept “one country, two systems” and wa proud of it democratic way of life. “The vast majority in Taiwan resolutely oppose ‘one country, two systems’, This is the ‘Taiwan consensus’,” she said. “We call on China to bravely step forward for democracy, for only by doing so can it truly understand the people of Taiwan’s thinking and insistence.” Xi reiterated that China wa willing to talk with any party in Taiwan to push the political process - stalled by China since Tsai took office - a long a they accept the “one China” principle. Underscoring China’s nervousness about U.S. support in particular for Taiwan, U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday signed into law the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act, which reaffirms the U.S. commitment to Taiwan, including arm sales. Xi sought to reassure people in Taiwan that there wa nothing to fear from Chinese rule, even though most people there have shown no interest in being run by autocratic Beijing. “After peaceful reunification, Taiwan will have lasting peace and the people will enjoy good and prosperous lives. With the great motherland’s support, Taiwan compatriots’ welfare will be even better, their development space will be even greater,” Xi said. Tsai, who say she want to maintain the status quo with China, said on Tuesday China must use peaceful mean to resolve it difference with Taiwan and respect it democratic values. Beijing ha regularly sent military aircraft and ship to circle the island on drill in the past few year and ha heaped pressure on the island internationally, including whittling down it few remaining diplomatic allies. Taiwan is gearing up for presidential election in a year. Tsai’s party suffered stinging loss to the China-friendly Kuomintang in mayoral and local election in November. Xi wa speaking on the anniversary of the “Message to Compatriots in Taiwan” on Jan. 1, 1979, when China declared an end to what had been routine artillery bombardment of Taiwan-controlled offshore island and offered to open up communication between the two sides. However, the offer wa rebuffed by Taiwan’s then-president Chiang Ching-kuo, who in April that year came out with a “three nos” policy of no contact, no compromise and no negotiation with China. Chiang only relaxed that in 1987, allowing people in Taiwan to visit China for family reunions. His father, Chiang Kai-shek, fled with defeated Nationalist force to Taiwan in December 1949 after losing a civil war to the Communists.',\n",
       " 'The powerful Lebanese Shi’ite group Hezbollah belief a solution to be “very close” for the country’s impasse over forming a new government, one of it senior official said on Wednesday, following nearly eight month of political wrangling. Lebanese politician have been unable to agree a new government since a general election in May a rival party have competed over the allocation of cabinet positions, further unsettling the country’s fragile economy. Hezbollah, a heavily armed, Iran-backed movement set up in the 1980s to combat Israeli occupation, started taking part in electoral politics in the 1990s and is the most powerful group in the country. “We believe the solution is very close,” said Mahmoud Qamati, deputy head of the group’s political council, and suggested it could happen in time to be considered “a holiday gift”. “The intention held by everybody are positive and for the benefit of the country,” he added. On Tuesday, Prime Minister-designate Saad al-Hariri said he and President Michel Aoun had met and were “determined to form a government”, state news agency NNA reported. A breakthrough to create a national unity government in line with Lebanon’s sectarian power-sharing system seemed close last month, but it did not work out and the deadlock resumed. However, Hariri said on Sunday he still believed the government would form early in the new year. The lack of a government ha caused particular concern because Lebanon face both structural economic problem and regional instability. Lebanon ha the world’s third-highest level of debt to GDP and Finance Minister Ali Hassan Khalil said on Sunday it face an economic crisis that he warned could turn into a financial one. Hariri ha pledged to carry out economic reform that could unlock billion of dollar of international investment in Lebanese power, transport and data infrastructure, aimed at boosting the economy after year of weak growth. The International Monetary Fund ha stressed the importance of Lebanon putting it debt on a sustainable footing, while bond yield and the cost of insuring against Lebanese sovereign debt have shown sign of stress in recent months. Last month, Israel uncovered several tunnel it said Hezbollah had dug under the border, adding to tension between the country some 12 year after Israel and Hezbollah fought a war on Lebanese soil. Qamati said the government formation wa beneficial “particularly in light of the Israeli dangers”. The latest hitch in effort to form a government came over Sunni Muslim representation in the cabinet. Hariri said on Tuesday that only one difficulty remained and that he and Aoun were working to solve it.

He added that “Trump’s word and action have caused dismay around the world.” The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Romney suggested that “on balance, (Trump’s) conduct over the past two year ... is evidence that the president ha not risen to the mantle of the office.” Romney is staking out an independent position two day before he take office on Thursday. It is unclear whether Trump will face a serious challenge in 2020 to securing the Republican Party’s presidential nomination. Trump last February endorsed Romney’s run for a Senate seat in Utah. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Romney excoriated Trump a a “fraud” who wa “playing the American public for suckers.” Trump responded that Romney had “choked like a dog” in his unsuccessful 2012 campaign against Democratic President Barack Obama. Despite Romney’s prior criticism, after Trump won the presidency in November 2016, he briefly considered tapping Romney a secretary of state. In his essay on Tuesday, Romney said he “will speak out against significant statement or action that are divisive, racist, sexist, anti-immigrant, dishonest or destructive to democratic institutions.” Romney ha strongly defended press freedom and challenged Trump’s repeated attack on some news outlet a an “enemy of the people.” “The medium is essential to our Republic, to our freedom, to the cause of freedom abroad, and to our national security.

       " 'U.S. border agent launched tear gas into Mexico early on Tuesday to deter a group of migrant that one official called “a violent mob” from crossing over from Tijuana, according to a Reuters witness and the U.S. government. Clouds of the noxious gas could be seen wafting up from around the fence at the border. One migrant picked up a canister and threw it back into U.S. territory. U.S. official said the group had attacked agent with projectile but a Reuters witness did not see any migrant throwing rock at U.S. agents. Tijuana ha become a flashpoint in the debate over U.S. immigration policy, which ha been intensified by the recent death of two migrant child in American custody and a partial U.S. government shutdown over U.S. President Donald Trump’s demand for $5 billion (3.9 billion pounds) in funding for a wall along the border with Mexico. A previous incident in November when U.S. agent fired gas into Mexico to disperse migrant triggered a call from Mexico’s government for an investigation, a well a international condemnation. Mexico Foreign Ministry spokesman Roberto Velasco said the government “regrets the events” at the border. He said Mexico “advocates respect for migrants’ human rights, security and integrity, while calling for respect for law on both side of the border.” More than 150 Central American migrant approached an area of the border in Tijuana in the Playas neighbourhood near the beach late on Monday. Migrants said they thought security measure might be relaxed due to the New Year’s holiday. U.S. security personnel fired tear gas into Mexico after midnight a some migrant prepared to climb a border fence, according to the Reuters witness. During a second attempt, migrant began to pas youth and child over the razor wire along the fencing to the U.S. side. U.S. Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Katie Waldman called the group “a violent mob” and said they had thrown projectile at agent who responded with “the minimum force necessary to defend themselves.” “Congress need to fully fund the border wall,” Waldman said in a statement. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said in a statement the gas wa aimed upwind of people throwing rock on the Mexican side who obstructed agent from helping the child being passed over razor wire. The CBP statement said agent had not directly targeted the migrant attempting to cross the fence with tear gas and pepper spray. A Reuters witness documented in one photo where a migrant had been hit by what appeared to be a gas canister. Human right group Amnesty International’s deputy director of research Justin Mazzola described the use of tear gas against migrant “cruel and inhumane” and called for an independent investigation. “The Trump administration is defying international law and orchestrating a crisis by deliberately turning asylum-seekers away from port of entry, endangering family who see no choice but to take desperate measure in their search for protection,” he said in a statement. CBP said most of the migrant attempting to cross returned to Mexico while 25 people, including two teenagers, were detained. Thousands of Central American migrant have been camping at shelter in Tijuana since arriving in November after travelling in caravan across Mexico to reach the U.S. border, where many have hoped to request asylum. Mexico’s new leftist president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, ha sought not to antagonize Trump over the U.S. president’s demand for a border wall. He obtained a pledge from the United States to contribute billion of dollar for development in Mexico’s poor south and Central America in order to deter migration. Trump ha backed away from his campaign pledge to make Mexico pay for a wall, but just last week he threatened to close the border with Mexico unless he get the money he want from U.S. lawmaker for a barrier. The United States ha also pushed Mexico to house Central American migrant while they seek U.S. asylum.',\n",

       " 'Earnings at China’s industrial firm in November dropped for the first time in nearly three years, a slackening external and domestic demand left business facing more strain in 2019 in a sign of rising risk to the world’s second-largest economy. The gloomy data point to a further loss of economic momentum a a trade dispute with the United States pile pressure on China’s vast manufacturing sector and a firms, bracing for a tough year ahead, shelve their investment plans, executive say. Industrial profit fell 1.8 percent in November from a year earlier to 594.8 billion yuan (68.2 billion pounds), the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on it website on Thursday. It marked the first decline since December 2015. The fall in profit largely reflected slowing growth in sale and producer price a well a rising costs, He Ping of the statistic bureau said in a statement accompanying the data. Economists expect earnings to continue to worsen next year, weighed down by smaller gain in industrial price due to cooling demand, with some even warning of the risk of deflation. “Soft economic indicator such a producer prices, industrial output and order all point to further pressure on corporate profitability,” said Nie Wen, a Shanghai-based analyst at Hwabao Trust, adding that firms’ revenue have been hit by shrinking demand. “Industrial profit next year might very well post a 5-10 percent decline on average.” In November, China’s factory price growth slowed to the weakest pace in two year a domestic demand lost further momentum. “Survival is paramount for u (next year) – we will be more cautious with our investments,” Jiang Ming, chairman of Henan-based Tianming Group that ha business in healthcare, construction and finance, told Reuters. “We also need to maintain better cashflows and save our ammunition to prepare for the tight, tough and difficult day ahead.” China’s economy expanded at the slowest pace last quarter since the global financial crisis, hit by a years-long deleveraging campaign, cooling property market and a trade dispute with the United States, and is expected to cool further next year. The growing pressure ha prompted the government to roll out a range of measure to juice up demand. In a key annual economic conference held this month the country’s top leader said they will ratchet up support for the economy in 2019 by cutting tax and keeping liquidity ample, while promising to push forward trade negotiation with the United States. At the beginning of this month, U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping agreed to a 90-day truce delaying a planned U.S. tariff hike on Jan. 1 a they negotiate a trade deal. Yet there is uncertainty whether the two side can bridge their difference over a myriad of issue - including trade and intellectual property right - to reach a durable pact. Earnings growth at China’s industrial firm ha been cooling since April this year a factory price gain slowed on the back growing strain in the global economy. The bitter trade war with the United States ha also pressured overall output and demand in a blow to business investment plans. For the first eleven months, profit at industrial firm rose 11.8 percent from the same period a year earlier to 6.1 trillion yuan, slowing from a 13.6 percent increase in January-October. In the same period, earnings growth at state-owned industrial enterprise also cooled. Upstream sector such a oil extraction, coal and metal mining still commanded the lion’s share of profit gain in the 11-month period but again their growth softened in November. Profits for oil and natural gas extraction rose 333 percent in the first eleven month of the year, easing off from a 371 percent jump for January-October. “The next drag on profit would likely come from upstream sector where raw material price have been sliding fast,” Hwabao Trust’s Nie said. With the arrival of winter, industrial output ha taken a hit a the government intensifies a crackdown on pollution to restrict production in smoke-belching factories. China’s top steelmaking city Tangshan asked steel mill earlier this month to cut extra output during December 9 and 31, which is an additional reduction on top of that ordered during the winter heating season. All of this pointed to more bad news for business next year. “We expect the downtrend in industrial profit growth to extend into 2019 given weakening domestic demand, the continued credit downcycle and an escalation in the China-US trade conflict,” Nomura analyst said in a note to clients.',\n",
       " 'Myanmar youth activist and television host Thinzar Shun Lei Yi would once have called herself one of Aung San Suu Kyi’s greatest fans. Now, she is one of her most vocal critics. The 27-year-old belongs to a small but high-profile group of liberal activists, many former die-hard Suu Kyi supporters, who are growing increasingly disillusioned with the administration they voted into power with sky-high hope three year ago. “I lost my idol, I’m confused, frustrated and lost,” said Thinzar Shun Lei Yi, who host an ‘Under 30’ talk show on a popular local website. “Most of the activist and youth are now thinking: ‘What is next’, ‘What will happen?’, ‘What can we do?’ At this stage, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi is going her own way and nobody can intervene, and she won’t listen to civil society organisations,” she said, using the honorific for woman in Myanmar. While Suu Kyi continues to inspire devotion among many ordinary Burmese, the emergence of a dissenting youth movement – driven by anger over her handling of ethnic minorities, including the Muslim Rohingya, a well a curb on the medium and civil society – present a new challenge for her administration. At stake is the future of Myanmar’s transition towards democracy after year of military rule. With a general election looming in 2020, the country’s first civilian government in decade is confronted by growing division among activist who once coalesced around her National League for Democracy party. NLD spokesman Myo Nyunt said the party wa trying to win over young people, increasing the budget for education and supporting vocational training programmes. “The youth and the people expected a lot from our government,” he said. “We couldn’t live up to their expectations, we admit. But we are doing our best.” Suu Kyi took power in 2016 after a landslide election win, vowing to continue democratic reform and end the country’s long-running civil wars. Since then, the administration ha come under pressure over it response to a military crackdown against the Rohingya minority that the United Nations ha described a “ethnic cleansing” with “genocidal intent”, a well a faltering peace talk with ethnic armed group and a stagnating economy. Activists say the civilian government ha also become increasingly authoritarian, failing to use it overwhelming parliamentary majority to scrap colonial-era law used to stifle dissent, while tightening restriction on civil society. In recent months, they have staged several protests, including an anti-war march in the commercial capital of Yangon in May that ended in scuffles. A total of 17 people were charged with unlawful protest, including Thinzar Shun Lei Yi. Their trial is ongoing. “Sensitive issue are banned, and protester arrested and beaten,” she said. “The National League of Democracy, the party using the name of democracy, must respect democracy and human rights.” According to free speech organization Athan, which mean ‘Voice’ in Burmese, 44 journalist and 142 activist have faced trial since the Suu Kyi government took power. They include Reuters reporter Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, who were sentenced to seven year in prison in September after being convicted of breaking the colonial era Official Secrets Act. The journalist are appealing their conviction to the country’s High Court, citing evidence of a police set-up and lack of proof of a crime. Suu Kyi said in September their jailing had nothing to do with freedom of expression. The government say Myanmar’s court are independent. Athan’s founder, poet and activist Maung Saung Kha, wa among the protester charged alongside Thinzar Shun Lei Yi in May. Four month later, in September, they both helped organise another demonstration, this time for free speech. Facing the crowd, Maung Saung Kha – who is still an NLD member – donned the orange shirt traditionally worn by his party’s lawmaker and draped a green jacket resembling military garb over it. Armed with a copy of the state-run daily newspaper The Mirror, he began beating journalist gathered nearby. “The government ha failed to use it power to protect people’s rights,” he told Reuters. Myo Nyunt, the party spokesman, said the government wa cooperating with non-governmental organisations, but their activity needed to be examined case-by-case. “If it is not related to security or not a divisive issue among ethnics, we accept them,” he said. “We are going forward to democracy so we acknowledge the role of NGOs, but we have concern that NGOs are being influenced by sponsor instead of being independent.” While she ha no control over the military, Suu Kyi ha faced international criticism for failing to defend the Rohingya, more than 730,000 of whom fled a sweeping army crackdown in western Rakhine state in 2017, according to U.N. agencies. The operation wa launched in response to insurgent Rohingya attack on security forces. Myanmar denies almost all the allegation of atrocity made by refugees, saying the army wa carrying out a legitimate campaign against terrorists. While many among Myanmar’s Buddhist majority revile the Rohingya, the young activist offer a rare sympathetic voice. “We acknowledge Rohingya. We totally denounce the fact that they are referred to a ‘Bengali’,” said Maung Saung Kha, referring to a term commonly used in Myanmar to imply the Rohingya are interloper from Bangladesh, despite a long history in the country. “We haven’t seen any acknowledgement or punishment for the thing that happened,” he said. “The refugee will not come back a long a these people think of them a le than humans, and that it is not a crime to kill them.” Khin Sandar, another young activist facing unlawful protest charges, spent month campaigning for the NLD ahead of the 2015 election but lost faith in Suu Kyi over her handling of the Rakhine crisis. Her family wa affected in a wave of communal violence in 2012, when not only Rohingya but member of the Kaman Muslim minority, who also face discrimination but unlike the Rohingya are considered Myanmar citizens, were driven from their homes. They live in crowded internal displacement camp outside the Rakhine state capital Sittwe and are subjected to severe restriction on movement. In a speech after last year’s violence, Suu Kyi said all resident of Rakhine “have access to education and healthcare service without discrimination”. “My own nephew and niece are still living in the Sittwe camp and they don’t have those rights,” said Khin Sandar. “I wa shocked. How can she say that in her speech?” Afterwards, she said, she quit her job a researcher for an NLD lawmaker. While the youth activist represent only a small segment of Myanmar society they are increasingly influential in the grassroots activism scene, while their protest and public comment have attracted significant attention from medium and from their vast social medium followings. Mostly in their 20 and 30s, they highlight the gulf between Myanmar’s young population – the median age is 27 – and it ageing leadership, comprised of mostly men in their 60 and 70s. “Myanmar is a very conservative country, these young people especially from Yangon are now challenging that,” said Myat Thu, a political analyst from the Yangon School of Political Science. “In order to have a revolution of ideas, not many people need to know. They will spread it gradually.”',\n",
       " 'Myanmar police have clashed with insurgent in the troubled western state of Rakhine, state-run medium said on Wednesday, a intensified fighting continued between the security force and an armed group representing the Buddhist Rakhine ethnic group. The United Nations said about 2,500 people had been driven from their home since early December when clash broke out with the Arakan Army, one of several group fighting Myanmar’s army that want more autonomy for ethnic minorities. The Myanmar military last month announced a four-month halt in fighting in the north and northeast of the country in order to kick-start stalled peace talk with the armed groups. Rakhine, in the west, wa excluded from the pause, stoking doubt about the military’s willingness to bring an end to all the country’s conflicts. Rakhine wa where the military launched a campaign in 2017 that ha driven more than 730,000 Rohingya Muslims into bordering Bangladesh. Recent fighting ha involved the Arakan Army, which claim to represent the Rakhine, the Buddhist ethnic group who make up the majority in the state of the same name. The state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper said one policeman wa critically injured when border guard police were attacked by about 30 men carrying “small and heavy arms” on Tuesday near Saytaung, a village in the Buthidaung area. Khine Thu Kha, a spokesman for the Arakan Army, denied that the group attacked the police, but said the group did clash with government security force in Saytaung on Tuesday. Hundreds of border guard police had been deployed in area far from the border with Bangladesh a part of a broader military offensive against the group, Khine Thu Kha told Reuters on Wednesday. “Today the fighting started at 8 a.m.” in another location, he said. Major General Tun Tun Nyi, a military spokesman, declined to comment. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said on Monday that 1,500 people were newly displaced by fighting last week in Rakhine, in addition to about 1,000 people displaced since clash broke out on Dec. 8. Authorities, along with local and foreign aid groups, were providing aid to the displaced, the U.N. agency said in an update.

       " 'Australia’s government is confident it ha ground to strip an alleged Islamic State recruiter of citizenship, a minister said on Wednesday, a question arose over whether doing so could be illegal and leave the man stateless. The case highlight the problem many government face a they consider what action to take against people who have travelled abroad, often to the Middle East, to join militant groups. Under Australian law, a person can only be stripped of their citizenship if they are dual citizens, thereby preventing people from being made stateless. Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton said Melbourne-born Neil Prakash, who is imprisoned in Turkey, wa a dual citizen a he also ha Fijian citizenship,. Prakash ceased to be an Australian “by virtue of his action in fighting for Islamic State from May 2016”, and he had been notified of the decision in December, Dutton said. “The advice to the government based on all the intricate detail and fact of this particular matter is that Mr Prakash is, by operation of law, a citizen of Fiji,” Dutton told reporter in Brisbane. “The other point to make is that Mr Prakash is sitting in a Turkish jail at the moment ... Prakash is not coming anywhere near our part of the world any time soon.” Prakash ha been in Turkey on trial for charge relating to being a member of the Islamic State militant group since being caught there in October 2016. Australia belief Prakash is a dual national because his father wa Fijian. However, Fiji’s director of immigration, Nemani Vuniwaqa, told Reuters in a Facebook message that Prakash wa not Fijian, which could complicate the Australian government’s bid to strip him of his citizenship. Prakash can challenge the Australian government’s decision, Dutton said, and he could be entitled to retain his citizenship if he doe not hold dual-citizenship status. The government wrongly reported in 2016, based on U.S. intelligence, that Prakash had been killed in an air strike in Mosul, Iraq. The government said he had appeared in Islamic State video and magazine and had actively recruited Australian men, woman and children, and encouraged act of terrorism He is also wanted in Australia over terrorism-related activity including a suspected plot to behead a police officer, though an Australian push for his extradition wa rejected by Turkey in July. A spokesman for the Fijian prime minister could not be reached for comment on Wednesday.',\n",
       " 'Afghanistan’s neighbours, caught off-guard by report of U.S. plan to withdraw thousand of troops, have begun preparing for the risk that a pullout could send hundred of thousand of refugee fleeing across their borders, diplomat say. Alarmed by the possibly of a chaotic withdrawal, diplomat from neighbouring country who have been in talk with U.S. official in Kabul said they were reassessing policy and would ramp up border preparations. “At this point there is no clarity about the withdrawal, but we have to keep a clear action plan ready,” said a senior Asian diplomat based in Kabul. “The situation can turn from bad to worse very quickly.” A White House spokesman last week said U.S. President Donald Trump had not issued order to the Pentagon to withdraw troop from Afghanistan. But the administration ha not denied report that the United States plan to pull out almost half of the 14,000-strong force currently deployed. The report come amid an intensification of move towards peace negotiation in Afghanistan. U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad met Taliban representative last month and discussed issue around a future troop withdrawal a well a proposal for a ceasefire. But even among regional power such a Iran, Pakistan or Russia that have long been suspicious that the United States want permanent military base in South Asia, there is no appetite for a sudden U.S. withdrawal, say analysts. “While the news of a potential U.S. drawdown may be a reason for cautious optimism in the region, they don’t want an abrupt withdrawal,” said Graeme Smith, a consultant for the International Crisis Group. “All side recognise that a precipitous pullout could spark a new civil war that destabilises the region. The neighbour do not enjoy surprises, and the uncertain signal from Washington are causing anxiety.” The United States, which sent troop to Afghanistan in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001 attack on New York and Washington and at the peak of the deployment had more than 100,000 troop in the country, withdrew most of it force in 2014, but still keep around 14,000 troop there a part of a NATO-led mission aiding the Afghan security force and hunting militants. The top U.S. general in Afghanistan said 2019 wa going to be an interesting year. “The policy review is going on in multiple capitals, peace talk out there, regional player pressing for peace, the Taliban talking about peace, the Afghan government talking about peace,” said General Scott Miller, the U.S. commander of Afghanistan’s NATO-led force, at the Resolute Support mission headquarters in Kabul. Pakistan, which wa already working to fence it 1,400 km (870 miles) frontier with Afghanistan and deploy a 50,000-strong paramilitary force along the border, is preparing for a fresh influx of refugee in the event of disorder. “Camps will be set up near the border to manage a fresh wave of Afghan refugee and illegal migrant and Afghans will not be allowed to set up illegal home in Pakistan,” said an official, speaking on condition of anonymity. Afghanistan, which share border with Pakistan, Iran, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and China, is already the world’s second biggest source of refugees, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The International Organisation for Migration (IOM) estimate that approximately 1.4 million undocumented Afghans live in Pakistan and possibly 1.2 million in Iran. While thousand of undocumented Afghans were driven out of Iran by recent political and economic turbulence, Iranian official in Kabul said they fear a sudden U.S. troop withdrawal could reverse that trend. “We are working closely with the Afghan government to stop Afghans from entering our country. We don’t want to use violence to stop them, but a sudden U.S. pullout will lead to a crisis,” said an Iranian official. Afghanistan doe not share a land border with Turkey, but Afghans enter Turkey from Iran to work a shepherds, farmer or in the construction sector. Many use it a a transit point to try to enter Europe. “We have not closed our door but the number of illegal migrant is increasing on a daily basis,” said Mehmet Ozgur Sak, the second secretary at the Turkish embassy in Kabul. In 2018, Turkish police say they intercepted 90,000 Afghans who were trying to enter the country with fake document or with the help of traffickers, double the number in 2017. As negotiation over the future of the country gather momentum, the Taliban have been trying to reassure Afghans that they have nothing to fear after foreign force leave. But there are Afghans who refuse to trust the Taliban’s new stance. Sayed Rafi Sadat, a student in western Herat province, said the Taliban would impose harsh law to destroy democracy. “If U.S. troop withdraw then there is no hope for the future and we will have to leave the country,” he said.

There wa a clear intention by this man to kill foreigners,” Herbert Reul, interior minister of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, where Bottrop is located, told reporter on Tuesday.

The strongly-worded assessment from the UK, European Union, and United States could hit the image of Hasina, who won a third straight term to power following Sunday’s election. Hasina’s opponent have rejected the election result, citing what they describe a widespread rigging and voter intimidation. She ha denied impropriety, calling it a peaceful vote that saw enthusiastic participation from her supporters. The capital Dhaka wa quiet on Tuesday, but the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) said it worker were being attacked in several area elsewhere in the country by activist of the Awami League - charge the party denied. “Violence ha marred the election day, and significant obstacle to a level playing field remained in place throughout the process and have tainted the electoral campaign and the vote,” the EU said in a statement, calling for “a proper examination of allegation of irregularities”. The United States, Bangladesh’s largest foreign investor, expressed concern about “credible report of harassment, intimidation, and violence in the pre-election period that made it difficult for many opposition candidate and their supporter to meet, hold rallies, and campaign freely.” “We are also concerned that election-day irregularity prevented some people from voting, which undermined faith in the electoral process,” it said. The UK’s Minister of State for Asia and the Pacific Mark Field echoed the concerns, saying he wa “aware of credible account of obstacles, including arrests, that constrained or prevented campaigning by opposition parties. “I urge a full, credible and transparent resolution of all complaint related to the conduct of the elections,” he said. Police say at least 17 people were killed in election day clash between supporter and opponent of Hasina’s Awami League. The two sides, which have competed for power often violently for decades, traded blame for the election day unrest. Opposition BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam said he wa collecting report of rigging to submit to the Election Commission to demand a fresh vote. The commission already rejected that plea, but Islam said: “What is our alternative?” One journalist wa arrested and another wa on the run after a local government official filed a case against them for publishing “false information” about election irregularities, under a new law journalist say could be used to stifle dissent. Hedayet Hussain Mollah and Rashidul Islam published report saying more vote had been cast at one constituency in the southeastern Khulna region than the total number of registered voter there. They were accused under the Digital Security Act enacted in September. Mollah wa picked up by police on Tuesday afternoon while Islam wa on the run, police said. “This is false information that wa made intentionally to make the election result look questionable and controversial,” a police report said. The deadly clash on voting day marked the end of a violent campaign. The opposition said it worker faced arbitrary arrest and candidate were attacked by ruling party activists. The ruling party denied being behind any violence. “People have shared experience of being physically assaulted and manhandled at polling stations,” said Saad Hammadi, Amnesty International’s regional campaigner for South Asia, calling for an impartial probe into incident of violence. Hasina, whose father, state founder Mujibur Rahman, wa assassinated in a coup in 1975, ha alternated in and out of power for nearly three decade with her main rival, BNP leader Zia Khaleda. Khaleda wa jailed in February for corruption. Additional reporting by Enamul Haque in Khulna and Serajul Quadir in Dhaka; Editing by Peter Graff All quote delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

       " 'On the 60th anniversary of Cuba’s revolution, ruling Communist Party leader Raul Castro blasted the Trump administration for returning to an outdated path of confrontation with the island nation and of intervening in Latin America. Castro and his late, elder brother Fidel Castro led the rebel band that in 1959 overthrew a U.S.-backed dictator and installed a Communist-run country on the doorstep of the United States, setting the scene for decade of Cold War hostility. At the time, their revolution inspired leftist movement throughout Latin America, but the celebration on Tuesday came a the region is shifting rightwards, coinciding with the inauguration of Brazil’s far-right President Jair Bolsonaro. Some of Cuba’s closest allies, Venezuela and Nicaragua, are mired in political crises, and U.S. President Donald Trump ha tightened the decades-old U.S. embargo on the island, after his predecessor, Barack Obama, had sought to normalise relations. “Once again, the North American government is taking on the path of confrontation with Cuba,” Castro said in the southeastern city of Santiago de Cuba where Fidel Castro proclaimed victory six decade ago. The speech by Castro, who stepped down a president in April but remains head of the Communist Party until 2021, wa part of a solemn, sunset ceremony in a cemetery where both Fidel Castro and independence hero Jose Marti are buried. “Increasingly, high-ranking official of this administration are ... trying to blame Cuba for all the region’s ills,” he said, adding that they stemmed instead from “ruthless neoliberal policies”. Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, said in November that Washington would take a tougher line against Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua, calling them a “troika of tyranny.” Clad in military fatigue and cap, the 87-year old Castro said on Tuesday that Cuba had proven throughout six decade of revolution it could not be intimidated by threats. Instead it remained open, he said, to a peaceful and respectful coexistence. Cuba’s true battle this year wa an economic one, he added, reiterating comment made at the national assembly in late December by his successor, President Miguel Diaz-Canel, who announced increased austerity for the fourth year running in 2019 in the face of a cash crunch. “We need first of all to reduce all non-necessary expense and to save more,” said Castro. A decade ago, a president, he introduced a series of reform to liberalize and boost the centrally planned economy, yet it remains heavily state-dominated and bound in red tape. A series of external shock such a a decline in aid from Venezuela and devastation wrought by hurricane have also dented growth, which is sluggish at best. Nonetheless, the Cuban revolution is on a secure footing thanks to the transition to a competent younger generation of leader such a the 58-year old Diaz-Canel, Castro said. “It is opportune to express the fact that the Cuban Communist Party decidedly back the word and action of Diaz-Canel since he took office,” Castro said. “The revolution ha not aged, it remains young,” he said.',\n",

       " 'Peruvian President Martin Vizcarra said on Tuesday he would ask Congress to declare the public prosecutor’s office in a state of emergency after the agency’s top official removed two investigator at the heart of the probe into a massive graft scandal triggered by Brazilian builder Odebrecht. Vizcarra, who had been attending the inauguration of President Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil, cut short his trip to deal with the surprise twist in the Odebrecht case, saying he would return home to fight against “corruption and impunity.” Vizcarra said he would personally present a bill to Peru’s Congress at 1 p.m. local time (1800 GMT) on Wednesday seeking the state of emergency, and asked for legislative support to usher it through quickly and without conflict. “We will use all the tool our Constitution contemplates to overturn this decision, and we ask that all branch of government do the same,” Vizcarra told reporter after meeting with his cabinet and adviser in Lima. A state of emergency would allow Vizcarra to quickly and efficiently make change to personnel he deems necessary to advance the investigation. His move came just hour after Peru’s top prosecutor, Pedro Chavarry, removed prosecutor Jose Perez and Rafael Vela, saying the duo had failed to respect authority at Peru’s public prosecutor’s office, which ha overseen the investigation. Chavarry’s move prompted a public outcry in Peru, where there is strong support for Vizcarra’s anti-corruption crusade. The two deposed investigator earlier this month announced they would seek fine of about $180 million from local companies, politician and businessmen for taking part in kickback scheme involving Odebrecht [ODBES.UL] construction project in Peru. Odebrecht in 2016 admitted in a plea deal with U.S., Brazilian and Swiss authority that it had bribed official in a dozen countries, including Peru. The team Perez and Vela helped lead ha targeted people at the highest level of power in the Andean nation. Four former Peruvian presidents, the current opposition leader and several local construction company are all under investigation in connection with Odebrecht. All have denied wrongdoing. Chavarry’s decision to remove Perez and Vela wa announced day after Perez accused Chavarry of allegedly obstructing justice in a separate case involving several judge accused of corruption. Perez and Vela had also targeted former Peruvian president Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, Ollanta Humala y Alejandro Toledo, all of whom are under investigation in connection with the Odebrecht scandal. Vizcarra said on Monday that Odebrecht should not be able to continue working in Peru because the Brazilian construction company had “contaminated private activity” and admitted bribing public officials.',\n",

Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s office said he would attend the briefing, which is set for Wednesday. It wa unclear whether the other leader would participate, one source said. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the specific of the briefing. The House and Senate will reconvene briefly on Wednesday to mark the last day of the Republican-controlled 2017-2018 Congress, with no sign of a workable plan to end the shutdown, which is now in it second week. About a quarter of the federal government is shut down, with roughly 800,000 worker affected. Democrats, who won control of the House in the November elections, plan to approve on Thursday a two-part spending package meant to end the shutdown. But it prospect are grim in the Republican-led Senate, which previously approved similar measure on the floor or in committee but ha since fallen in line with Trump’s demand for funding for the border wall. The legislation will set the stage for the first major battle of the new Congress between House Democrats led by Nancy Pelosi and Senate Republicans led by McConnell. “We are giving the Republicans the opportunity to take yes for an answer,” Pelosi, who is expected to be the House speaker, said in a letter to colleague released by her office on Tuesday. “Senate Republicans have already supported this legislation, and if they reject it now, they will be fully complicit in chaos and destruction of the president’s third shutdown of his term.” Trump triggered the shutdown, which began on Dec. 22, by insisting that $5 billion (3.92 billion pounds) in funding for the border wall be part of any spending measure. “Border Security and the Wall ‘thing’ and Shutdown is not where Nancy Pelosi wanted to start her tenure a Speaker! Let’s make a deal?” Trump tweeted on Tuesday. Trump call the wall crucial to curbing illegal immigration, echoing his 2016 presidential campaign pledge. During his run for the White House, Trump insisted Mexico would pay for the wall. The Democrats’ two-part spending package includes a bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security at current level through Feb. 8 and provide $1.3 billion for border fencing and $300 million for other border security item including technology and cameras. The second part of the package would fund federal agency that are now unfunded, such a the Justice, Commerce and Transportation departments, through Sept. 30, the end of the federal fiscal year.

       " 'President Donald Trump on Tuesday expressed confidence in Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin amid worry over a weakening economy and a stock market slump, but repeated his criticism of the U.S. Federal Reserve, saying it ha raised interest rate too quickly. Speaking to reporter in the Oval Office after a Christmas video conference with U.S. troop deployed abroad, Trump also said U.S. company were “the greatest in the world” and presented a “tremendous” buying opportunity. Asked if he ha confidence in Mnuchin, Trump said: “Yes, I do. Very talented guy. Very smart person,” he said. His comment came after Mnuchin on Monday held a conference call with U.S. regulator to discus plunging U.S. stock markets. The call did more to rattle market than to assure them. All three major U.S. stock index ended down more than 2 percent on the day before the Christmas holiday. The S&P 500 ha lost about 19.8 percent from it Sept. 20 closing high, just shy of the 20 percent threshold that commonly defines a bear market. Mnuchin also spoke on Sunday with the head of the six largest U.S. banks, who confirmed they have enough liquidity to continue lending and that “the market continue to function properly.” Investors said his move to convene a call with the president’s Working Group on Financial Markets, known a the “Plunge Protection team,” may have weighed on sentiment. On Tuesday, Trump praised U.S. company and said their lower stock price present an opportunity for investors. “I have great confidence in our companies. We have companies, the greatest in the world, and they’re doing really well. They have record kind of numbers. So I think it’s a tremendous opportunity to buy.” U.S. stock have dropped sharply in recent week on concern over weaker economic growth. Trump ha largely laid the blame for economic headwind on the Fed, openly criticizing it chairman, Jerome Powell, whom he appointed. “They’re raising interest rate too fast because they think the economy is so good. But I think that they will get it pretty soon,” Trump said, repeating his criticism. Media report have suggested Trump ha gone a far a discussing firing Powell, and he told Reuters in August that he wa “not thrilled” with the chairman. On Monday, Trump said “The only problem our economy ha is the Fed.” The Fed hiked interest rate again last week, a had been widely expected.',\n",
       " 'U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday said the partial shutdown of the federal government wa going to last until his demand for fund to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border is met. The U.S. government partially shut down on Saturday, and there is not yet any sign of tangible effort to reopen agency closed by a political impasse over Trump’s demand for border wall funds. “I can’t tell you when the government is going to reopen,” Trump said, speaking after a Christmas Day video conference with U.S. troop serving abroad. “I can tell you it’s not going to reopen until we have a wall, a fence, whatever they’d like to call it. I’ll call it whatever they want, but it’s all the same thing. It’s a barrier from people pouring into the country, from drugs.” He added: “If you don’t have that (the wall), then we’re just not opening.” Funding for about a quarter of federal program - including the department of Homeland Security, Justice and Agriculture - expired at midnight on Friday. Without a deal to break the impasse, the shutdown is likely to stretch into the new year. Building the wall wa one of Trump’s most frequently repeated campaign promises, but Democrats are vehemently opposed to it.',\n",
       " 'President Donald Trump set off a Christmas social medium storm when he questioned whether a seven-year-old wa too long in the tooth to believe in Santa Claus. But not to worry. The child, Collman Lloyd, from Lexington, South Carolina, told the Post and Courier newspaper she wa still a believer. She and her two sibling left iced sugar cooky and milk out for Saint Nick overnight and, in the morning, the treat were gone and present were under the tree. Twitter had lit up after Trump, capping a week of plunging stocks, a government shutdown and the U.S. defence chief’s unceremonious departure, cast doubt on the cherished childhood fantasy. “Are you still a believer in Santa?” Trump asked Collman in a phone call. “Because at seven, it’s marginal, right?” In a video her family posted on the Internet, she replied “Yes sir,” later telling the newspaper she had no idea what “marginal” meant. Trump made the comment during a holiday event with first lady Melania Trump, taking call from child calling the North American Aerospace Defense Command Santa tracker. A Christmas tradition, the tracker delight child with “real-time” update on his Christmas Eve journey. “It’s just too freaking fantastic that Trump spent his Christmas Eve calling seven-year-olds and telling them believing in Santa at their age is ‘marginal,’” Democratic Senator Chris Murphy said on his Twitter account. “Actually there is no heaven,” tweeted Dan Amira, head writer for “The Daily Show with Trevor Noah” comedy show. “When you die you just rot in the ground and get eaten by worms. Okay Merry Christmas, Timmy.” The White House had no immediate comment on the social medium response to the president’s Santa comments. Stuck in Washington on Christmas morning because of the partial federal government shutdown, Trump displayed little holiday cheer to reporter after a 20-minute video conference with U.S. troop serving abroad. He assailed the Federal Reserve for raising interest rates, railed against Democrats who refuse to fund the wall he want to build on the U.S.-Mexico border, and blasted the investigation into his campaign’s alleged tie to Russia, among other regular targets.

       " 'Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives plan to vote on Thursday on a funding package to end the 10-day-old partial U.S. government shutdown, without providing the $5 billion (3.92 billion pounds) President Donald Trump ha demanded for a U.S.-Mexico border wall. The planned vote set up a Democratic showdown with Trump’s fellow Republicans on an issue dear to the president on the first day of divided government in Washington since he took office in January 2017 with a Congress led by his own party. Democrats formally take control of the House from the Republicans after winning a majority of seat in November’s congressional elections. The two-part Democratic package filed on Monday in the House includes a bill to keep funding for the Department of Homeland Security at current level through Feb. 8 with no new wall funding, a well a a bundle of six measure worth nearly $265 billion combined that would fund the other shuttered agency through the Sept. 30 end of the current fiscal year. The two part will be voted on separately on the House floor on Thursday, said Democrats, who will hold a 36-seat majority. If approved in the House, the funding package would go to the Republican-led Senate. Its prospect there appear unpromising, although Trump’s unpredictability make it hard to gauge how the shutdown showdown will play out. “It’s simple: The Senate is not going to send something to the president that he won’t sign,” said a spokesman for Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell. The Democratic legislation will mark the first major battle pitting the incoming Democratic House majority led by Nancy Pelosi against Trump and McConnell. “While President Trump drag the nation into Week Two of the Trump Shutdown and sits in the White House and tweets, without offering any plan that can pas both chamber of Congress, Democrats are taking action to lead our country out of this mess,” Pelosi and top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer said in a joint statement. Democrats oppose Trump’s demand for wall funding, with Pelosi calling the wall immoral, ineffective and expensive. Democrats hope their two-pronged funding approach will put Senate Republicans in a tough position. If they reject funding for department unconnected to border security, Republicans could be seen a holding those agency and their roughly 800,000 affected worker hostage to Trump’s wall demand. “Then they are complicit with President Trump in continuing the Trump shutdown and in holding the health and safety of the American people and workers’ paycheck hostage over the wall,” Pelosi and Schumer said in their statement. Non-border-related agency include the Departments of Agriculture, Interior, Transportation, Commerce and Justice. The homeland security piece of the package includes $1.3 billion for border fencing and roughly $300 million more for other border security item including camera and technology. Democrats said the entire package is based on legislation that ha already been passed by either the Senate or Senate committees. The shutdown, which began on Dec. 22 and ha idled roughly a quarter of the federal government, wa precipitated by Trump’s demand, under pressure from conservative commentators, that Congress approve $5 billion to help fund a wall that wa a promise made in his 2016 election campaign, although he said at the time it would be paid for by Mexico. Trump ha called the wall crucial to combating illegal immigration and drug trafficking. The Senate on Dec. 21 failed to muster the vote needed to pas Republican-backed House legislation that included Trump’s wall funding. Passage in the Senate would need at least some Democratic support to reach the 60-vote threshold required. A central issue in finding a resolution could be the definition of what constitutes a wall, including the idea of steel slat and other type of barrier versus a concrete structure. Trump on Twitter criticized Democratic opposition to the wall project, which carry a total estimated price tag of $23 billion. He also seemed to contradict comment made by outgoing White House Chief of Staff John Kelly. In a Los Angeles Times interview published on Sunday, Kelly said: “To be honest, it’s not a wall.” “The president still say ‘wall’ - oftentimes frankly he’ll say ‘barrier’ or ‘fencing,’ now he’s tended towards steel slats. But we left a solid concrete wall early on in the administration, when we asked people what they needed and where they needed it,” Kelly added. Trump wrote on Twitter that border security could not exist “without a strong and powerful Wall.” “An all concrete Wall wa NEVER ABANDONED, a ha been reported by the media,” Trump wrote. “Some area will be all concrete but the expert at Border Patrol prefer a Wall that is see through (thereby making it possible to see what is happening on both sides). Makes sense to me!” Trump, who cancelled his vacation in Florida and ha stayed at the White House during the holiday government shutdown while first lady Melania and their son Barron were at Trump’s private estate Mar-a-Lago in Florida for New Year’s Eve, said Democrats could have come over for talk anytime. “I’m in Washington. I’m ready, willing and able,” Trump told Fox News. White House official did not reply to an email asking whether the president had been in touch directly with Democratic leader to set up a round of talks. Pelosi ha not heard formally from the White House since Dec. 11, when she and Schumer had a contentious Oval Office meeting with the president, Democratic aide said. Schumer ha not heard from the White House since he met with Vice President Mike Pence and incoming White House acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney on Dec. 22, Democratic aide said.',\n",

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said a he met with Pompeo in the Brazilian capital that he planned to discus how to intensify intelligence and operation cooperation in Syria and elsewhere to block Iranian “aggression.” In his first public comment on Trump’s decision, Pompeo said it “in no way change anything that this administration is working on alongside Israel.” “The counter-ISIS campaign continues, our effort to counter Iranian aggression continue and our commitment to Middle East stability and the protection of Israel continues in the same way it did before that decision wa made,” he said. Trump announced last month that he planned to withdraw U.S. troop from Syria, declaring that they had succeeded in their mission to defeat Islamic State and were no longer needed in the country. In making the announcement, Trump ignored the advice of top national security aide and did so without consulting lawmaker or U.S. ally participating in anti-Islamic State operations. The decision prompted Jim Mattis to resign a defence secretary. “We have a lot to discuss,” said Netanyahu, who like Pompeo wa in the Brazilian capital for the inauguration of Jair Bolsonaro a Brazil’s new president. “We’re going to be discussing our, the intense cooperation between Israel and the United States which will also deal with the question following the decision, the American decision, on Syria and how to intensify even further our intelligence and operational cooperation in Syria and elsewhere to block Iranian aggression in the Middle East.”Netanyahu said Israel wa very appreciative of the “strong ... unequivocal support” Pompeo gave Israel’s “efforts at self defence against Syria” in the past few days.

Francis delivered the traditional papal “Urbi et Orbi” (to the city and the world) message to ten of thousand of people in a sunny St. Peter’s Square from the same basilica balcony where he first appeared a pontiff shortly after his election on March 13, 2013. Security ha been tight around the Vatican for the Christmas season, with military jeep stationed at key access route and tourist undergoing metal detector and bag searches. Last week police in southern Italy arrested a Somali man suspected of having been a member of Islamic State and who had threatened to bomb church in Italy, including St. Peter’s. In his address, in what appeared to be a reference to the shrill political climate in a number of countries, Francis called for “fraternity among people with different ideas, yet capable of respecting and listening to one another”. Francis, the first pope from Latin America, alluded to polarisation over migration, saying God wanted “love, acceptance, respect for this poor humanity of ours, which we all share in a great variety of races, languages, and cultures”. “Our differences, then, are not a detriment or a danger; they are a source of richness,” he said. Francis, 82, called for the resumption of dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians to “undertake a journey of peace that can put an end to a conflict that for over 70 year ha lacerated the land chosen by the Lord to show his face of love”. He urged the international community to work for a political solution in Syria and said he hoped a truce brokered in Yemen’s civil war could bring relief to a population exhausted by violence and famine. The Argentinian-born pope also called for social harmony in Nicaragua and Venezuela, both racked by internal political conflicts. The million of refugee or displaced people in Africa who are in need of humanitarian assistance and food security should not be forgotten, he said. In Ukraine, he called for “a peace respectful of the right of every nation”.

       " 'Food aid meant for starving Yemenis is being stolen and sold in some area controlled by the Houthi movement, the U.N. World Food Programme (WFP) said on Monday. The Houthis control most town and cities, including the capital Sanaa, from where they ousted Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi’s government in 2014. A Saudi-led coalition intervened against the Houthis in 2015 with the aim of restoring his government. After hearing that humanitarian food wa being sold on the open market in Sanaa, WFP said it found many people had not received the food ration to which they are entitled, and that at least one local partner organisation affiliated with the Houthi Ministry of Education wa committing fraud. “This conduct amount to the stealing of food from the mouth of hungry people,” WFP Executive Director David Beasley said. “At a time when child are dying in Yemen because they haven’t enough food to eat, that is an outrage. This criminal behaviour must stop immediately.” A Houthi official expressed “deep disappointment” with the statement, saying it wa “not in line with WFP practices.” “We are surprised by this position, which is not backed by evidence and proof... We welcome the formation of independent committee to investigate the violations,” said Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, the head of the Houthis’ Supreme Revolutionary Committee, in a statement sent to Reuters. Yemen’s war and the ensuing economic collapse have left 15.9 million people, 53 percent of the population, facing “severe acute food insecurity” and famine wa a danger if immediate action wa not taken, a survey said this month. WFP is trying to get food aid to a many a 12 million severely hungry people. It said it monitor had gathered photographic and other evidence of truck illicitly removing food from designated food distribution centre and local official falsifying record and manipulating the selection of beneficiaries. “It wa discovered that some food relief is being given to people not entitled to it and some is being sold for gain in the market of the capital,” the WFP statement said.

       " 'Thousands of demonstrator marched in Hong Kong on Tuesday to demand full democracy, fundamental rights, and even independence from China in the face of what many see a a marked clampdown by the Communist Party on local freedoms. Over the past year, country such a the United States and Britain have expressed concern about a number of incident they say have undermined confidence in Hong Kong’s freedom and autonomy under Chinese rule. These include the jailing of activists, a ban on a pro-independence political party, the de facto expulsion of a Western journalist and barring democracy activist from contesting local elections. The New Year’s day march included call to restart stalled democratic reform and to fight “political repression” from Beijing. “Looking back at the year that passed, it wa a very bad year ... The rule of law in Hong Kong is falling backwards,” said Jimmy Sham, one of the organisers. Organisers said the march drew 5,500 people, revised down from an earlier estimate of 5,800, while police said 3,200 people were on the street at the march’s peak. The former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula, with the promise of a high degree of autonomy and universal suffrage a an “ultimate aim”. While authority have clamped down hard on the city’s fringe, pro-independence movement, that didn’t deter around 100 independence activist from joining the march, holding up banner and chanting for the city to split from China. China considers Hong Kong to be an inalienable part of it territory, and denounces “separatists” a a threat to national sovereignty, even though the movement ha not garnered much popular backing in the city. “There will be continuous suppression on the Hong Kong independence movement, but the movement will grow stronger and stronger,” said Baggio Leung, an independence leader who said several of his member had been harassed by purported “triads” or gangsters, before the march. Last year, in an unprecedented move, Hong Kong authority banned a political group, the Hong Kong National Party, for it pro-independence stance on national security grounds. A western journalist, Victor Mallet, wa also effectively expelled from Hong Kong, soon after he hosted a talk at a press club by the head of the National Party. Mallet’s visa denial, which the government ha so far refused to explain, wa criticised by some foreign government and the American Chamber of Commerce. Some protester carried “wanted” poster of Hong Kong’s top legal official, Theresa Cheng, criticising a decision to drop a corruption investigation into Hong Kong’s former pro-Beijing leader Leung Chun-ying, without a satisfactory explanation. “I’m afraid the pressure will continue,” said Joseph Cheng, a veteran right campaigner and retired professor who wa raising money for a “justice” fund for activist facing hefty legal fee for several trials. “We’re going to face a few difficult years, but we must stand firm ... Unlike in mainland China, at least we can still protest.”',\n",
       " 'Italy’s Uffizi Galleries called on Germany on Tuesday to return a still-life painting by the Dutch master Jan van Huysum, which wa looted by retreating Nazi troop in World War Two. “Germany ha a moral duty to return this painting to our museum,” said Uffizi chief Eike Schmidt, who is himself German. “This story is preventing the wound inflicted by World War Two and the horror of Nazism from healing.” The “Vase of Flowers” painting, worth million of dollars, wa originally put on display in Florence in 1824 after it wa bought by Grande Duke Leopoldo II for his art collection. The oil canvas hung in the city’s Pitti Palace until 1940, when it wa evacuated to a nearby village following the outbreak of World War Two. Three year later it wa seized by German troop and eventually taken to Germany where it only resurfaced following German reunification in 1991 in the hand of a family. Intermediaries have demanded payment for it return, which the Uffizi is refusing. All effort to get it back via legal channel have failed, with Germany saying it cannot intervene because of a statute of limitation that prevents prosecution for alleged crime committed more than 30 year ago. “Germany should not apply the statute of limitation to work of art stolen during the war,” said Schmidt, who on Tuesday hung a black and white photograph of the missing canvas in the Pitti Palace museum. The word “stolen” written in Italian, English and German is prominently printed on the photo and the picture wa put on the Uffizi’s Twitter feed.',\n",
       " 'Democratic Republic of Congo’s government cut internet connection and SMS service across the country for a second straight day on Tuesday a the country nervously awaited result from the weekend’s chaotic presidential election. Both the opposition and ruling coalition said on Monday they were on track to win after a turbulent election day on Sunday in which many Congolese were unable to vote due to an Ebola outbreak, conflict and logistical problems. Barnabe Kikaya bin Karubi, a senior adviser to President Joseph Kabila, said internet and SMS service were cut to preserve public order after “fictitious results” began circulating on social media. “That could lead u straight towards chaos,” Kikaya told Reuters, adding the connection would remain cut until the publication of complete result on Jan. 6. The signal to Radio France Internationale (RFI), one of the most popular news source in Congo, wa also down, and the government withdrew the accreditation of RFI’s main correspondent in the country late on Monday for having aired unofficial result from the opposition. The various move reflected high tension in Congo, where the long-delayed election wa meant to choose a successor to Kabila, who is due to step down next month after 18 year in power - and two year after the official end of his mandate. Congo ha never seen a democratic transfer of power, and any disputed outcome could lead to a repeat of the violence that followed the 2006 and 2011 election and a wider security breakdown in it volatile eastern provinces. The opposition say the election wa marred by fraud and accused Kabila of planning to rule from the sideline through his preferred candidate, former interior minister Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary. Internal U.N. reports, seen by Reuters, noted allegation of irregularity across the country. In some part of eastern Congo’s North Kivu province, for example, militia fighter reportedly forced voter to select candidate from the ruling coalition, they said. In other places, the United Nations received report that security force intimidated voter to choose ruling coalition candidates. The government and national electoral commission (CENI) said the election wa fair and that any problem were minor. In the eastern city of Goma, resident were on edge a they awaited the results. “If the result during the publication of the presidential result don’t reflect the truth ... trouble will break out across the city,” said Fabrice Shweka, a Goma resident. The first partial result were initially expected on Tuesday but CENI spokesman Jean-Pierre Kalamba said that they would not be ready until around Friday. “We don’t want to release too many voting trend (before Jan. 6) because in our country we don’t have a population that ha the same understanding (of electoral practice a in Europe),” he told Reuters. In a statement late on Monday, the embassy in Congo of the European United, United States and several other country called for calm and urged the government to restore internet access. Shadary faced off in Sunday’s poll against two main opposition challengers, Felix Tshisekedi and Martin Fayulu, both of whom opinion poll before the vote showed running ahead of Shadary. Fayulu complained in a statement on Monday about irregularity during Sunday’s vote but said he wa encouraged by the determination of Congolese to vote despite long queue and voting machine that broke down. “I call for vigilance across the board and the general mobilisation of all Congolese so that the truth of the ballot box, the sole witness to the will of the Congolese people, can reward their effort and sacrifices,” he said.

       " 'India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is confident of doing well at this year’s general election despite the party’s recent loss in state polls, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in an interview with Reuters partner ANI on Tuesday. “No reason for morale down. We are confident and are moving ahead. In 2019, if there is one party which the country trust and is connected with the people, it is the BJP,” Modi said. India’s ruling party lost power in three key state in December, handing Modi his biggest defeat since he took office in 2014 and boosting the Congress party opposition and it ally ahead of national poll due by May. Modi said it wa more important to focus on his government’s achievements, including the introduction in September of a new healthcare scheme for the poor. “In such big number people suffering, today they have got treatment, how can I consider this a failure. It is my biggest achievement,” Modi said. He said party ha been discussing what it lacked at the state election but winning or losing wa not the only yardstick. The Hindu nationalist BJP wa willing to work with regional party in the run-up to the general election, he said. “Our effort is to take everyone along, and listen to everyone. I am committed to give importance to regional aspirations. The country cannot be run by ignoring regional aspirations.” Modi said farm loan waiver should be “definitely done” if it help but that wa not a long-term solution to the problem of farmer distress. “What is lacking in our system, that farmer becomes debt-ridden and the government have to repeat vicious cycle of election and loan waivers. So solution is to empower the farmers. From seed to market, give all facility to the farmers,” he said. Farmers’ anger about low crop price and their sense that the government ha done far too little to address them contributed to the state election defeats. The government is now considering three option for a relief package to help farmer suffering because of low crop price at a cost of a much a 3 trillion rupee ($43.20 billion), three government source told Reuters last week. Former Reserve Bank of India governor Urjit Patel had personally written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi about wanting to resign, citing personal reasons, several month before stepping down from the office in December, Modi said. “The governor himself requested (to resign) because of personal reasons. I am revealing for the first time, he wa telling me about this for the past 6-7 month before his resignation. He gave it even in writing. He wrote to me personally”. Patel resigned after a months-long tussle over policy with the government that raised concern about the bank’s independence a the next general election nears. When asked if there wa any political pressure on the governor to resign, Modi denied that wa the case. “No such question arises. I acknowledge that Patel did a good job a RBI Governor.”',\n",

General Scott Miller, who command U.S. force and the NATO-led non-combat Resolution Support (RS) mission in Afghanistan reiterated the need for a political settlement to end the conflict. “Peace talk (are) out there, regional player pressing for peace, the Taliban talking about peace, the Afghan government is talking about peace,” Miller told dozen of NATO soldier who had gathered at RS headquarters in Kabul for an exercise session. Dressed in gym gear, Miller participated in a 60-minute open-air morning workout of sprints, squats, burpees and push-ups. He did not comment on report that the United States wa considering pulling out almost half of the 14,000-strong force currently deployed in Afghanistan. A White House spokesman said last week that U.S. President Donald Trump had not issued order to withdraw the troops. However, the administration ha not denied the reports, which have also prompted fear of a fresh refugee crisis. “Are (the RS) able to adapt? Are we able to adjust? Are we able to be in the right place to support positive process and negative consequences, that’s what I ask you guy to think about in 2019,” Miller said. With the help of it allies, the U.S. launched a military campaign in Afghanistan 17 year ago to topple the Taliban government following the September 2001 strike on American cities. The longest American war effort ha since killed nearly 140,000 people, including security forces, insurgent and civilians, and ha cost Washington close to a trillion dollars. Officials from the warring side have met at least three time to discus the withdrawal of international force and a ceasefire in 2019. However, fighting ha not subsided even a diplomatic effort intensify. “As long a the Taliban want to fight we are going to fight,” said Colonel David Butler, spokesman for U.S. Forces in Afghanistan. He added that 2019 would bring a unique opportunity for peace in the country that ha been at war on and off for almost 40 years, since U.S.-backed Afghan guerrilla fought to repel Soviet Union force in the late 1970s. “Think of this — 40 year of war ha a possibility of coming to an end,” Butler said. In their 2018 annual report, the Taliban said they had successfully forced the U.S. to invite them to the negotiating table. “The Mujahideen defended valiantly...the invader were forced to review their war strategy,” the hardline Islamic militant group said in a statement.

       " 'Pope Francis, in his first message of the new year on Tuesday, bemoaned a lack of unity across the world, and warned against a soulless hunt for profit that benefit only a few. “How much dispersion and solitude there is all around us. The world is completely connected, yet seems increasingly disjointed,” the pope said in his traditional New Year’s Mass in St. Peter’s Basilica. In his homily he paid homage to motherhood, saying a world that looked to the future while forgetting “a mother’s gaze” wa shortsighted. “It may well increase it profits, but it will no longer see others a children. It will make money, but not for everyone. We will all dwell in the same house, but not a brother and sisters,” he said. The New Year’s address followed a turbulent 2018 for the pope, whose Church wa battered by a torrent of sex scandal across the world that Francis ha repeatedly failed to contain. The sense of crisis wa underscored on Monday when the Vatican spokesman and his deputy abruptly and unexpectedly resigned following disagreement on communication strategy. Pope Francis made no overt reference to the tumult, but called for Roman Catholics to remain rooted to the Church, saying: “Unity count more than diversity.” He also warned that Church risked becoming “a beautiful museum of the past” if people lost “the amazement of faith”.',\n",
       " 'Former Nissan Motor Co (7201.T) Representative Director Greg Kelly ha been released on bail after more than a month in detention on financial-misconduct charges, a a Tokyo court rejected prosecutors’ request to keep the American executive in custody. Kelly and Carlos Ghosn, the automaker’s ousted chairman, were detained upon arrival in Japan on Nov. 19 on suspicion of understating Ghosn’s income in financial statement for several years. The arrest jolted the global car industry and strained Nissan’s alliance with French car maker Renault SA (RENA.PA). Ghosn remains in custody. A crowd of Japanese and international reporter and camera crew had gathered since Tuesday morning waiting for Kelly’s release. He left the Tokyo Detention Centre with his lawyer, Yoichi Kitamura, by taxi at around 10:45 p.m. (1345 GMT), a Reuters witness said. Kelly said in a statement that he had not falsified any document and looked forward to restoring his honour in court, adding that he wanted to return to his family a soon a possible, Japanese public broadcaster NHK reported. There wa no answer at Kitamura’s office when contacted by Reuters for comment. The ruling by the Tokyo District Court came after an appeal by Kelly’s family in Tennessee. He paid bail of 70 million yen (503,395 pounds) in cash, the court said. But he could be barred from leaving Japan or talking to people related to the case, NHK said earlier in the day, although exception can be made for overseas travel on a case-by-case basis. Kelly’s wife, Dee Kelly, appealed for his release in a video statement last week, saying her husband had been “wrongly accused a part of a power grab by several Nissan executives”, that he and Ghosn “fully believe that they did not break the law” and citing her husband’s need for surgery for spinal stenosis. A Nissan spokesman said the car maker wa not in a position to comment on the latest twist in the more-than-month-long saga. “The company’s own investigation uncovered substantial and convincing evidence of misconduct, resulting in a unanimous board vote to dismiss Ghosn and Kelly a chairman and representative director. Our investigation is ongoing,” the spokesman said. Both Kelly and Ghosn remain on the Japanese car maker’s board but without representative rights. The court on Sunday extended Ghosn’s detention for 10 days, following fresh allegation of making Nissan shoulder personal investment losses. Ghosn wa re-arrested on Friday based on suspicion that around October 2008 he shifted personal trade to Nissan to make it responsible for 1.85 billion yen ($16.6 million) in appraisal losses, prosecutor said. Prosecutors also said Ghosn had inflicted damage on Nissan by having it deposit a total of $14.7 million on four occasion between June 2009 and March 2012 into a related bank account. Ghosn will remain in Tokyo’s main detention centre, where he ha been confined since his arrest in November, at least until Jan. 1.',\n",

       " 'Pope Francis led the world’s Roman Catholics into Christmas on Monday, urging people in the developed world to seek a simpler, le materialistic life and condemning the yawning gap between the rich and the poor. Francis, 82, marking the sixth Christmas of his papacy, led a solemn service for nearly 10,000 people in St. Peter’s Basilica for his traditional Christmas Eve Mass. Security ha been tight around the Vatican and many other tourist area in Rome for the Christmas season. Last week police in southern Italy arrested a Somali man suspected of having been a member of Islamic State and who had threatened to bomb church in Italy, including St. Peter’s. In his homily, Francis said the infant Jesus, born in poverty in a stable, should make everyone, particularly those who have become “greedy and voracious,” reflect on the real meaning of life. “... Let u ask ourselves: Do I really need all these material object and complicated recipe for living? Can I manage without all these unnecessary extra and live a life of greater simplicity?” Francis said. “In our day, for many people, life’s meaning is found in possessing, in having an excess of material objects. An insatiable greed mark all human history, even today, when, paradoxically, a few dine luxuriantly while all too many go without the daily bread needed to survive,” he said. Francis, the first pope from Latin America, ha made defending the poor a hallmark of his papacy. On Saturday, the Vatican said he had given the homeless in Rome a Christmas gift of a new clinic in St. Peter’s Square where they can get free medical help.

King Maha Vajiralongkorn, 66, ha been serving since shortly after his father died in 2016 following a 70-year reign. “His Majesty deems it fit to hold the coronation ceremony per royal tradition for the good fortune of the nation and the kingdom, to be enjoyed by the hopeful people,” a palace statement said. In the three-day coronation, the king will be officially crowned on May 4 and a celebration procession will be held on May 5. The king will meet the public and foreign dignitary on May 6, the palace said. Vajiralongkorn, also known by the title King Rama X, became Thailand’s constitutional monarch two year ago following the death of his revered father, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, on Oct. 13, 2016. His official coronation ha been delayed until after a year-long mourning period for Bhumibol, who wa cremated in October 2017 in a grand royal funeral in Bangkok. King Bhumibol wa revered by Thais during his seven decade on the throne and the deep relationship between the monarchy and the military helped facilitate a smooth royal transition following his death. Since then, Vajiralongkorn ha overseen sweeping change to royal affairs, including the running of palace finances, which were formerly managed by the government. Thailand ha been a constitutional monarchy since 1932, but the king remains supremely regarded a the spiritual protector of it people and culture. The kingdom is due to hold election on Feb. 24, and the current election timeline mean the coronation will likely take place before a new government is formed. The election are meant to restore democracy after a 2014 military coup ousted an elected prime minister, though change to the constitution in the interim ensure the military will retain a great deal of control.',\n",

For the multitude who gathered in the famed midtown Manhattan crossroads, the thrilling moment wa reward for enduring hour of standing in a steady downpour during the waning hour of 2018. Helping to keep spirit high wa a slate of performer including Christina Aguilera, New Kids on the Block and Sting who entertained the resilient crowd. Many donned plastic rain poncho and sported colourful, oversized top hat handed out by organizers. “It wa a bucket-list thing,” said Daniela Ramous, a 34-year-old sale manager from McAllen, Texas. “You grow up watching it on TV, you see all the excitement. There’s something magical about New York during this time of year.” Injecting a sombre note into the festivities, the Times Square Alliance, the business association that organises the event, paid a special tribute to freedom of the press, after a year in which journalist came under attack around the world, including in the United States. A minute before midnight, an invited group of journalist from ABC News, NBC News, the Washington Post, Reuters and other outlet joined Mayor Bill de Blasio in pushing the button that initiate the glittering ball’s drop. Visitors had begun gathering inside penned-off enclosure in the morning, starting an hours-long marathon of standing in one place, with no access to public restrooms. Belying the idea that New Yorkers themselves eschew the Times Square festivities, Eskie Garcia, a 59-year-old city worker living in Brooklyn, said she ha come every year for about a decade. “You have to come here in person,” she said before applying lipstick and asking a stranger to take her picture on her cellphone. “Especially when you live by yourself. You come, you meet people.” Janette Masson, 29, said she preferred this year’s rain to last year’s bone-chilling cold. Masson, who work in retail in Boston, had been in her pen since 9.30 a.m., eating granola bar for lunch and dinner. “I can deal with it,” said Masson’s 61-year-old mother, Judy Masson, a she stood in the rain with many hour of waiting still to come. “You make the best of a bad thing.” Umbrellas were banned a part of the tight security plan, reflecting concern over the possibility of random attacks. Plastic poncho were allowed, with street vendor selling them for $5 on nearby avenues. The Werline family from San Antonio, Texas, parlayed a connection with a friend who work at the Hard Rock Cafe into a coveted dry spot. Even though they did not have ticket for the private party inside, they had been permitted to stand under the attraction’s deep awning. “Thank God we know someone,” Tammy Werline, 49, said a rain cascaded off the awning’s edge and people in suit and cocktail dress buzzed in and out of the restaurant, almost directly below the glowing ball. The tradition of watching a giant ball drop from a pole on top of the narrow building at the head of Times Square in midtown Manhattan began in 1907. The ball in current use - a glittering, LED-studded sphere made by Waterford Crystal and Philips Lighting - made it debut in 2008. Weighing 11,875 pound (5,386 kg) and measuring 12 foot (3.7 meters) in diameter, it sits year-round on the roof of One Times Square, the one-time headquarters of the New York Times. As in year past, the New York Police Department screened people entering the corrals, deployed sharpshooter on rooftop and used radiation detector throughout the event. It also had planned to use an aerial drone for the first time to monitor the crowds, but cancelled the effort on Monday evening given the wind and rain. The organizer chose to honour press freedom and the contribution of journalist partly because of the deadly hostility that some reporter have faced this year.

China fear Tsai wish to push for Taiwan’s formal independence, though Tsai say she want to maintain the status quo. Beijing ha regularly sent military aircraft and ship to circle the island on drills. Taiwan is gearing up for presidential election in a year’s time. Tsai’s pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party suffered stinging loss to the China-friendly Kuomintang in mayoral and local election in November. In a new year’s address at the presidential office in Taipei, Tsai said the two side of the Taiwan Strait needed a pragmatic understanding of the basic difference that exist between them in term of value and political systems. “Here, I would like to call on China to face squarely the reality of the existence of the Republic of China on Taiwan,” Tsai said, referring to the island’s formal name. China “must respect the insistence of 23 million people on freedom and democracy, and must use peaceful, on parity mean to handle our differences”, she added. China’s interference in the island’s political and social development is “Taiwan’s biggest challenge at the moment”, Tsai said. China denies any interference in Taiwan’s internal affairs. China view Taiwan a a wayward province, to be brought under it control by force if needed, with no right to international recognition a a separate political entity. Democratic Taiwan ha shown no interest in being ruled by autocratic China. Liu Jieyi, head of China’s Taiwan Affairs Office, said in his new year’s message they had not wavered last year in the face of “deliberate provocations” from Taiwan’s government. “Although the way ahead won’t all be plain sailing, we have the confidence and the ability to vanquish risk and challenges,” he said in a statement on the office’s website. On Wednesday, Xi will give a speech to mark 40 year since a key policy statement that eventually led to a thaw in relation with Taiwan, the “Message to Compatriots in Taiwan”. On Jan. 1, 1979, China declared an end to what had been routine artillery bombardment of Taiwan-controlled offshore island close to China and offered to open up communication between the two sides, after decade of hostility. Chiang Kai-shek fled with defeated Nationalist force to Taiwan in December 1949 after losing a civil war to the Communists.Despite the deep business, cultural and personal link which exist today, no peace treaty or formal end to hostility ha been signed.',\n",

Previously it had a goal of 308 ships, and the actual size of the Navy had generally been between 270 and 290 ships, according to the Congressional Research Service. A 355-ship fleet would include 12 aircraft carriers, one more than the previous goal. The United States currently operates 11 aircraft carriers, several time more than any other country.',\n",
       " 'Indonesian military and rescue team fanned out across a stretch of coastline on Monday, hoping to find survivor of a tsunami triggered by a landslide from a volcano that killed at least 373 people. Thick cloud of ash spewed from Anak Krakatau, a volcanic island where a crater collapse at high tide late on Saturday set off wave that smashed into coastal area on both side of the Sunda Strait between the island of Sumatra and Java. Rescuers used heavy machinery and bare hand to dig body out of mud and wreckage along a 100 km (60 mile) stretch of Java’s west coast. More than 1,400 people were injured, and about 12,000 resident had to move to higher ground, with a high-tide warning extended to Wednesday. The vast archipelago, which sits on the Pacific “Ring of Fire”, ha suffered it worst annual death toll from disaster in more than a decade. Earthquakes flattened part of the island of Lombok in July and August, and a double quake-and-tsunami killed more than 2,000 people on a remote part of Sulawesi island in September. “At least 373 people have died, while 128 people are currently missing,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the disaster mitigation agency, said on Monday evening. (For graphic on Indonesia tsunami disaster zone, click tmsnrt.rs/2RdjsMd) Saturday’s tsunami destroyed more than 700 buildings, from small shop and house to villa and hotels. It took just 24 minute after the landslide for wave to hit land, and there wa no early warning for those living on the coast. Vehicles were crushed by wave that lifted chunk of metal, felled trees, wooden beam and household item and deposited them on road and rice fields. Nurjana, 20, ran uphill after the tsunami hit. Her beachside snack stall wa washed away. “I opened the door straight away and saved myself. I jumped over the wall,” she said. “Everything is destroyed.” Out in the strait, Anak Krakatau (Child of Krakatau) wa still erupting on Sunday night, belching white smoke and ash into the sky. The meteorology agency that an area of about 64 hectares, or 90 soccer pitches, of the volcanic island had collapsed into the sea. In 1883, the volcano then known a Krakatoa erupted in one of the biggest blast in recorded history, killing more than 36,000 people in a series of tsunami, and lowering the global surface temperature by one degree Celsius with it ash. Anak Krakatau is the island that emerged from the area in 1927, and ha been growing ever since. The high wave isolated hundred of people on Sebesi island, about 12 km from the volcano. “We are completely paralyzed,” Syamsiar, a village secretary on the island, told Metro TV, calling for food and medicine. President Joko Widodo, who is running for re-election in April, told disaster agency to install early warning systems, but expert said that, unlike with tsunami caused by earthquakes, little could have been done to alert people that wave were coming. “Tsunamis from volcanic flank collapse are generated right at the coast and often close to populations,” said Eddie Dempsey, lecturer in structural geology at Britain’s University of Hull. “The interval between the volcanic collapse and the arrival of the wave is minimal.” The timing of the disaster over the Christmas season evoked memory of the Indian Ocean tsunami triggered by an earthquake on Dec. 26, 2004, which killed 226,000 people in 14 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia. Families streamed out of the area on Monday for fear of further tsunami, jamming road already blocked by debris. Fishermen told how a light breeze wa followed by a huge wave that smashed together wooden fishing boat moored off the coast and pulled down the tree they were tied to. Excavators were being used to move debris including pile of steel roofing tangled like spaghetti. Medics were sent in with the military, while group of police and soldier reached remote areas. One team used sniffer dog to search for survivor at the beach club where a tsunami washed away an outdoor stage where the Indonesian rock band Seventeen were performing at a party for about 200 guests. They had already pulled out nine body that day. At a village 20 km away, district chief Atmadja Suhara said he wa helping to care for 4,000 refugees, many of them now homeless. “Everybody is still in a state of panic,” he said. “We often have disasters, but not a bad a this.” “God willing,” he said, “we will rebuild.” Additional reporting by Johan Purnomo and Adi Kurniawan in PANDEGLANG and Fanny Potkin, Tabita Diela and Wilda Asmarni in JAKARTA; Writing by Kanupriya Kapoor and Martin Petty; Editing by Kevin Liffey All quote delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

       " 'Turkey began reinforcing it position on both side of it border with Syria on Sunday, a Reuters witness said, a Ankara and Washington agreed to coordinate a U.S. withdrawal from Syria. The heightened military activity come two day after President Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey would postpone a planned military operation on Kurdish YPG militia east of the Euphrates river in northern Syria following the U.S. decision to pull out. He also said Turkey would take over the fight against Islamic State militants. The Turkish presidency said Erdogan and U.S. President Donald Trump in a phone call on Sunday agreed to establish military and diplomatic coordination to prevent an authority vacuum from developing a the United States withdraws. Earlier in the day, footage from broadcaster TRT World showed some Turkish convoy entering Syria via the Turkish border town of Karkamis, which is located some 35 km (22 miles) north of the northern Syrian town of Manbij. The convoy are crossing into an area controlled by the Free Syrian Army (FSA), a Turkish ally, and are heading to the frontlines of Manbij, TRT World said. Manbij ha been a major flashpoint between Ankara and Washington. In June, the NATO ally reached an agreement that would see the YPG ousted from the town but Turkey ha complained the roadmap ha been delayed and said Turkish force would enter the town if the United States doe not remove the Kurdish militants. The YPG ha been a main U.S. ally in the fight against Islamic State. Ankara say the militia is a terrorist organisation and an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which ha waged an insurgency in Turkey since the 1980s. A Reuters witness saw hundred of vehicle head to the southern border province of Kilis after leaving Hatay, another border province, around 0030 GMT on Sunday, a citizen sounded their horn to celebrate. The convoy included tanks, howitzers, machine gun and bus carrying commandos, the witness said. Part of the military equipment and personnel are to be positioned in post along the border while some had crossed into Syria via the district of Elbeyli situated some 45 km (28 miles) northwest of Manbij, Demiroren News Agency (DHA) reported. Reuters could not independently verify the reason for the reinforcement and Turkish official were not immediately available for comment. Turkey, with support from the FSA, carried out two cross-border operation in northern Syria, dubbed “Euphrates Shield” and “Olive Branch”, against the YPG and Islamic State. The military offensive were focused on area to the west of the Euphrates and Turkey ha not gone east of the river, partly to avoid direct confrontation with U.S. forces. The operation carved out de facto buffer zones, which are currently under the control of Turkey and the FSA.',\n",

The FSB said the American had been detained on Friday, but it gave no detail of the nature of his alleged espionage activities. Under Russian law, espionage can carry between 10 and 20 year in prison. A U.S. State Department representative said Russia had notified it that a U.S. citizen had been detained and it expected Moscow to provide consular access to see him. “We have requested this access and expect Russian authority to provide it,” the representative said, without providing detail of the identity of the American or the reason behind his detention. The English-language service of TASS news agency named him a Paul Whelan. David Whelan said in an email that he wa Paul Whelan’s brother and said that his brother had been arrested. He declined to comment on how he learnt of his brother’s detention, his work status at the time of his arrest and whether his brother lived in Novi, Michigan, a address record indicate. There wa online speculation that Paul Whelan had worked for global staffing firm Kelly Services, which is headquartered about a 40 minute-drive from Novi in Troy, Michigan. A spokeswoman for Kelly said a Paul Whelan had worked for the company until February 2016. “Kelly ha yet to confirm whether this former employee is the same individual reported upon in the news stories,” said Kelly spokeswoman Heather Klee.

       " 'U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a liberal firebrand who ha taken on Wall Street and traded barb with Donald Trump, on Monday became the most prominent Democrat to announce a challenge to the Republican president in 2020. Warren said she had formed an exploratory committee, which will allow her to begin raising money to compete in what is expected to be a crowded Democratic primary field before the November 2020 presidential election. She said on Twitter she would announce her decision on whether to run early in 2019. Warren, 69, a senator from Massachusetts since 2013, became one of Trump’s fiercest critic during the 2016 presidential race and they have continued to exchange biting insult during his presidency. Trump mockingly refers to her a “Pocahontas” because of her claim to Native American ancestry. Warren ha denounced Trump a an “insecure money grubber” with a platform of “racism, sexism and xenophobia,” while Trump ha described the former Harvard Law School professor a “goofy” and a “lowlife” with “a nasty mouth.” On Monday, Warren released a video in which she outlined her vision of a path to opportunity for all Americans and charged that the U.S. middle class wa under attack from corporate interests. She later elaborated on the theme in an exchange with reporter outside her Cambridge, Massachusetts, home. “America’s middle class is getting hollowed out and opportunity for too many of our young people is shrinking,” she said. “So I’m in this fight all the way. Right now Washington work great for the wealthy and the well connected. It’s just not working for anyone else.” Trump, in a phone interview with Fox News, said he would love to run against Warren and again ridiculed her assertion of Native American ancestry. Asked if he thought Warren really believed she could defeat him, Trump said: “I don’t know, you’d have to ask her psychiatrist.” The Democratic presidential field could eventually include Senators Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand, a well a former Vice President Joe Biden. Julian Castro, former President Barack Obama’s housing secretary, formed an exploratory committee this month. Warren welcomed the “strong and growing group of Democrats” making argument similar to those she is making, saying: “That’s how we build a movement. We do it together.” In searching for a candidate to run against Trump, Democrats will grapple with the tension between the party’s establishment and liberal progressive wing that flared during the 2016 nominating primary between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who ran under the Democratic banner. A Warren candidacy can expect opposition from Wall Street. In the U.S. Senate, she ha been a strong voice on financial issue and a self-described defender of the ordinary American against powerful interests. Following the 2007-2009 global financial crisis, Warren emerged a a leading critic of Wall Street and continues to advocate for stiffer regulation and oversight, including reinstating a rule that would separate banks’ retail business from their riskier investment banking activities. Warren, a member of the Senate Banking Committee, ha fought the Trump administration’s effort to weaken post-crisis financial rules, going a far a to attack moderate Democrats who backed a May rewrite of the 2010 Dodd-Frank reform law. In a September interview marking 10 year since the financial crisis, Warren wa asked about breaking up big banks. “Oh yeah,” she told the New York Times. “Give me a chance.” She also ha opposed the administration’s effort to undermine the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an agency she helped create, and ha pressured the Federal Reserve to take a tough line on scandal-hit lender Wells Fargo & Co . Many of Warren’s policy position have focussed on economic inequality. She recently offered legislation calling on the U.S. government to manufacture generic drug to reduce their cost. In 2017, she joined other senator in a proposal to extend the federal Medicare health insurance programme for senior to include everyone. Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel dismissed her a “another extreme far-left obstructionist and a total fraud.” Warren’s 80 percent name recognition doe not translate into actual support, University of Virginia professor Larry Sabato said. “Some Democrats swear by her and love her blunt style, while others are put off by her and fear she’d lose to Trump,” he said. “Warren ha a lot of convincing to do,” adding the same is true of many other Democratic contenders. Warren will begin campaigning soon in some of the state with early presidential nominating contests, a person familiar with her plan said. Trump’s use of Pocahontas, a 17th century Native American woman associated with the British colony in Jamestown, Virginia, wa aimed at drawing attention to a controversy over her heritage raised during Warren’s 2012 Senate race. Warren in October released a DNA analysis she said supported her assertion that she had Native American lineage. Trump’s reference ha drawn criticism from some Native American groups, while others criticized Warren for trying to lay claim to a tribal heritage.',\n",

Mattis, who had been seen a a stabilizing factor in U.S. defence policy, is due to transfer authority near midnight to his deputy, Patrick Shanahan, a former Boeing Co executive. Mattis, a retired Marine general who ha often shied from the spotlight, did not have any sort of departure ceremony when he left the Pentagon, leaving his farewell memo a his final public remark a defence secretary. Historically, departing secretary have had a major ceremony. In his brief message, Mattis acknowledged the political turbulence in Washington but called on the U.S. military to stay firm in it mission “to support and defend the Constitution while protecting our way of life.” “Our department is proven to be at it best when the time are most difficult. So keep the faith in our country and hold fast, alongside our allies, aligned against our foes,” Mattis said. Last week Trump said he wa replacing Mattis two month earlier than had been expected, a move official said wa driven by Trump’s anger at Mattis’ resignation letter and it rebuke of the president’s foreign policy. Mattis had abruptly quit after falling out with Trump, including over surprise decision to withdraw all troop from Syria and start planning a drawdown in Afghanistan. Mattis’ resignation letter laid bare the growing divide between them, and implicitly criticized the president for failing to value America’s closest allies, who fought alongside the United States in both conflicts. Shanahan, best known for his focus on internal Pentagon reform and his private-sector experience, will take over a acting defence secretary on Tuesday. Trump ha suggested Shanahan could stay in the role a acting secretary for a considerable amount of time. Shanahan ha served a the deputy secretary of defence since July 2017. Before joining the Pentagon last year, he spent three decade at Boeing and wa the general manager for the 787 Dreamliner passenger jet. Shanahan is not expected to break from major Pentagon policies, including a new focus on the military threat from China and Russia, which were outlined in the U.S. National Defence Strategy. \"Mr. Shanahan wa instrumental in crafting the National Defence Strategy.

       " 'Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Monday rejected opposition complaint of vote rigging and said people had gone to the poll enthusiastically in a general election that her ruling alliance swept with a landslide. The victory consolidates Hasina’s decade-long rule in the South Asian nation, in which her government ha overseen booming economic growth, but is accused of human right abuse and suppressing dissent - charge her government denies. In a victory speech at her official residence in the capital Dhaka, Hasina, 71, touted robust support for her Awami League-led alliance, which won 287 of the 298 seats, while the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)-led alliance got six seats. “They voted so enthusiastically,” Hasina told a room full of journalist and foreign election observers. “What do people want? They want to fulfil their basic needs. When they feel that yes, only this government can ensure it, then definitely they will vote for us.” The opposition rejected the result and called for a fresh vote, complaining of what it said wa widespread rigging. Neighbours India and China congratulated Hasina, and a visiting election monitoring group from South Asian country said they had found nothing amiss in voting in the capital Dhaka. There wa no immediate statement from the European Union or the United States, which had expressed concern last week over campaign violence it said had mostly impacted opposition candidates, and a delay in visa for many U.S.-funded observer who couldn’t make it into the country. At least 17 people were killed during Sunday’s poll that followed a violent election campaign in which both side blamed the other for casualties. Candidates reported witnessing ballot-stuffing and vote-rigging by ruling party activists, who also barred opposition polling agent from voting centres, said opposition leader Kamal Hossain. “We’ve had bad election in the past but I must say that it is unprecedented how bad this particular election was,” Hossain said. Bangladesh’s Election Commission said it wa investigating allegation of vote rigging but rejected demand for another vote. Human Rights Watch expressed concern over the election’s credibility and Amnesty International called for an impartial probe into “deeply disturbing” election violence. “ONE-PARTY STATE” The opposition BNP alleged it wa never granted a level playing field to campaign in the election, with thousand of it worker locked up on charge it termed a fictitious, and many candidate attacked by ruling party activists, crippling it campaign. The BNP had boycotted the last poll in 2014, not trusting Hasina to hold them fairly, and some BNP leader said Sunday’s vote had proved them right. The BNP went to the vote for the first time without it leader Khaleda Zia – Hasina’s arch rival and a former prime minister – who wa jailed in February on corruption charge she say were politically motivated. The rivalry between the two woman ha largely defined Bangladeshi politics for decades. Hasina on Sunday referred to the BNP a “terrorists”, saying the election had been “very peaceful” barring a few incident in which worker for her party were killed. She said the Election Commission wa independent and would investigate any allegation of rigging. Hasina, the longest-serving leader in the history of the Muslim-majority country of 165 million people, promised more development and an improved economy in her third straight term. Her adviser H.T. Imam said the government would consider raising the minimum wage for worker in it garment industry, which generates about 83 percent of export and is the world’s second-largest only after China’s. “Certainly, the Awami League enjoys strong constituency and ha support and it can get votes, but for any party to win more than 90 percent of the seat is simply too suspicious,” said Michael Kugelman, South Asia senior associate at the Washington-based Wilson Centre think-tank. “I fear that this election result signifies that Bangladesh ha really become something very closely approximating a one-party state.”',\n",
       " 'France’s embattled president, Emmanuel Macron, vowed on Monday to press on with his reform agenda in 2019 despite a spate of “yellow vest” protest that have challenged his government and extended a plunge in his approval ratings. Promised overhaul of France’s unemployment benefits, civil service and public pension will be undertaken in the coming year, Macron said in his televised New Year message. Confounding some expectation of a more contrite message, Macron struck an unapologetic note a he urged voter to face up to economic reality underpinning recently enacted reform of French labour rules, and others yet to come. “In recent years, we’ve engaged in a blatant denial of reality,” Macron said in the address, delivered - unusually - from a standing position in his Elysee Palace office. “We can’t work less, earn more, cut tax and increase spending.” In a veiled attack on the far-left and hard-right grouping active on the fringe of the often violent protests, Macron also decried self-appointed “spokespeople for a hateful mob” who he said had targeted foreigners, Jews, gay and the press. Almost 20 month after he became France’s youngest president, Macron’s popularity is at the lowest level recorded in modern French history. It stood at just 24 percent in late December compared to 47 percent a year earlier, according to a Journal du Dimanche aggregate of polls, a he struggled to draw a line under numerous setbacks. The current wave of demonstrations, which have brought disruption and destruction to Paris and other major cities, ha yet to abate despite fiscal giveaway and a increase in the wage for the poorest workers. Protesters were expected to join the New Year crowd thronging Paris’s Champs-Elysees Avenue overnight, amid a heavy police presence. A scandal over Macron’s former bodyguard Alexandre Benalla, who wa eventually fired after video emerged of him beating protesters, ha resurfaced with the revelation that he continued to travel on diplomatic passport and exchange message with Macron long after his dismissal. Macron said effort to bolster international control on immigration and tax evasion would be at the heart of European Union proposal he plan to announce in “coming weeks” - to be pursued in parallel with a domestic agenda reconciling ambitious reform with France’s commitment to social solidarity. “This is the line I have followed since the first day of my mandate, and which I plan to keep following,” he said. “This coming year, 2019, is in my view a decisive one.”',\n",

Netanyahu last week announced a snap election would be held in April, seeking a fresh political mandate that could help him weather possible charge in corruption investigations. The Israeli leader is enmeshed in three graft case and denies any wrongdoing. Should Israel’s attorney-general decide to press charge against Netanyahu, he would announce the indictment pending a hearing, after which charge could be filed in court. Asked at a news conference in Rio de Janeiro whether he would bow out of the election race should that happen, Netanyahu said: “I don’t intend to resign.” “According to the law, the prime minister doe not have to resign during the hearing process ... The hearing doesn’t end until my side is heard,” he said. “Imagine what would happen if a prime minister is ousted before the hearing is finished, and then after the hearing they decide to close the case. It’s absurd. It’s a terrible blow to democracy.” The indictment decision had been expected within weeks, but some analyst say the attorney general could opt to delay the move out of concern he might influence the outcome of the election.

Iraq, which doe not share a border with Israel, is technically it enemy but wa last an open threat in the 1991 Gulf War. Since a U.S.-led invasion in 2003 toppled Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, a Sunni Muslim, Israel ha worried that Iraq’s Shi’ite majority could tilt towards Iran. “Iraq is under growing influence of the (covert Iranian foreign operation unit) Qods Force and Iran,” military intelligence chief Major-General Tamir Hayman told a conference in Tel Aviv. With U.S. President Donald Trump disengaging from the region, Hayman said, the Iranians may “see Iraq a a convenient theatre for entrenchment, similar to what they did in Syria, and to use it a a platform for a force build-up that could also threaten the State of Israel”. Iraq’s prime minister said on Sunday that security official from Baghdad had met Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in Damascus, and hinted at a bigger Iraqi role fighting Islamic State militant a U.S. troop withdraw. Citing Iranian, Iraqi and Western sources, Reuters reported in August that Iran had transferred short-range ballistic missile to Shi’ite ally in Iraq. Baghdad denied the findings. The following week, Israel said it might attack such site in Iraq, effectively expanding a campaign now focussed on Syria. Hayman predicted 2019 would bring “significant change” to Syria, where Assad ha beaten back rebel with the help of Russia, Iran and Lebanese Hezbollah reinforcements, and where Trump this month ordered a pullout of U.S. troops. “This presence of Iran, with Syria’s return to stabilisation under a Russian umbrella, is something we are watching closely,” he said. Israel ha also been monitoring Iranian conduct since Trump quit the 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran in May and reimposed U.S. sanctions. The deal placed cap on nuclear project with bomb-making potential, though Iran denied having such designs. Trump, with Israeli support, deemed the cap insufficient. “We ass that Iran will strive to stay within the deal but will do everything in order to find way of circumventing the American sanctions,” Hayman said.

Jumana Ghunaimat, Jordan’s minister for medium affair and communication and the government spokeswoman, on Thursday walked over an Israeli flag painted on the floor of the headquarters of Jordan’s professional union in Amman. She wa on her way to attend a meeting between Jordanian Prime Minister Omar al Razzaz and union representatives. Razzaz, however, entered the building through a rear door, avoiding having to walk over the flag. Israel’s Foreign Ministry issued a statement on Sunday deploring the flag “desecration”, and said it had summoned acting Jordanian ambassador Mohammed Hmaid for a reprimand and that the Israeli embassy in Amman had also issued a “sharp protest”. The flag wa painted on the floor of the building several year ago to encourage passer by to tread on it, a mark of disrespect, union said at the time. Despite the neighbours’ 1994 peace deal and commercial and security ties, many Jordanians resent Israel and identify with the Palestinian struggle against it. Jordan’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Majed al-Qatarneh confirmed in a statement issued via state medium that the Israeli embassy in Amman had asked for clarification over the incident and that Israel had called in the Jordanian charge d’affaires in Tel Aviv to “discuss” the matter. Qatarneh said that Jordan respect it peace treaty with Israel and that Ghunaimat had entered a private building by it main entrance to attend an official meeting. The flag had been painted at a time when the union were controlled by Jordan’s mainly Islamist opposition, fierce ideological foe of Israel. They have since lost influence and Jordan’s professional union are mostly now run by nationalist and secular party that avoid party activism. Still, some union member were unhappy that union leader had allowed Razzaz to avoid the flag. “The union took a cowardly stance by allowing the prime minister to enter from a back door and his aide no doubt told him of the presence of the flag at the entrance,” Masira Malaas, a leading union activist, said.

The footage broadcast by A Haber show men carrying what it say were a total of five case through the main entrance of the residence, a short distance from the consulate where Khashoggi, a leading critic of Saudi policies, wa killed in early October. A Turkish official said the medium report, also carried by the pro-government Sabah newspaper on it website, appeared to be accurate, without giving further details. There wa no immediate reply from Saudi authority to a Reuters request for comment on the footage. Khashoggi wa a royal insider who became a critic of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and began writing for the Washington Post after moving to the United States last year. Saudi official have rejected accusation that the crown prince ordered his death. The murder ha sparked global outrage and damaged the international reputation of 33-year-old prince, the kingdom’s de facto leader. Sabah said the case had been brought to the residence in a black minibus at 3:09 pm (1209 GMT). After offering numerous contradictory explanation regarding the fate of Khashoggi, Riyadh later said he had been killed and his body dismembered when negotiation to persuade him to return to Saudi Arabia failed. Khashoggi’s remains have not been found and Turkey ha repeatedly asked Saudi Arabia where they are. Last month, Turkish police searched a remote villa in a coastal area southeast of Istanbul a part of the investigation.

Javid said there had been an increase in the number of migrant crossing the English Channel from France and last week he declared the situation a “major incident”. On Monday, following a meeting of official in London, he said two the additional ship would join three other vessel already working in the channel. He said 230 migrant had attempted to cross one of the world’s busiest shipping lane in December, although almost half were prevented from leaving France. The number is a tiny fraction of those regularly attempting to reach European Union territory by crossing the Mediterranean from northern Africa and Turkey, many of whom are fleeing conflict and poverty in the Middle East and Africa. But, their attempt to cross into Britain have attracted extensive domestic scrutiny amid a febrile political atmosphere le than three month before Britain leaf the European Union after a referendum in which immigration wa a major theme. “This will help both with the human side of this situation but also to better protect our borders,” Javid said of the deployment. The last three month accounted for around 80 percent of all attempt in 2018, Javid said, adding crossing were up in 2018 compared to 2017. The interior ministry said the majority of those who had arrived in Britain in the recent period were Iranian but said it did not routinely publish data and would not be providing a running tally or exact comparison with previous years. Local medium reported that 12 people arrived at a beach in southeast England by small boat on Monday. Javid cut short a holiday to oversee the response to the situation and is seen a one of those jostling to replace Prime Minister Theresa May after she said earlier this month she would step down before the next scheduled nation election in 2022. Concern over both legal migration and illegal immigration wa seen a an important driver of the 2016 vote to leave the European Union. “I don’t want people to think that if they leave a safe country like France, that they can get to Britain and just get to stay,” Javid said, outlining a desire to work with France to return a many of the migrant a possible.',\n",
       " 'Mexico’s new leftist President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Monday decreed tax cut for northern state that he say will help power economic growth and deter migration to the United States. An executive order in the government’s official gazette granted lower rate for both value-added and income tax in more than 40 municipality bordering the United States, an area that ha become a flashpoint over U.S. President Donald Trump’s policy to deter immigrants, including building a wall. Lopez Obrador’s tax cut could reduce government tax income during 2019, when he will implement a budget that seek to use spending cut to help fund new social welfare and infrastructure projects. At an event in Monterrey in the northern state of Nuevo Leon on Saturday, Lopez Obrador said the minimum wage in the northern strip of municipality would rise to 177 peso ($9.00), nearly double the national level, starting Jan. 1, and that fuel price would be set on a par with U.S. prices. “This is a very important project to boost investment and job creation,” Lopez Obrador told business leaders. The decree seek to give an edge to northern Mexican businesses, which compete with U.S.-based company across the border. Lopez Obrador ha vowed to increase economic development to deter migration to the United States. Trump want to make Mexico take in Central Americans who are seeking U.S. asylum. The plan will give business in the region a tax credit worth 50 percent of VAT dues. Companies that can show they earn more than 90 percent of their revenue in the area are eligible for an income tax credit worth one-third of dues. Last month, Citigroup economist estimated lower tax revenue from the north could cost the government around 120 billion peso ($6.10 billion) a year. A national chamber of business owners, Coparmex, welcomed the decree in a statement a a “judicious” measure that could spur investment in the region. The center-right National Action Party, the biggest opposition to Lopez Obrador’s leftist coalition in Congress, said the decree wa a “scam” since it fell short of a campaign promise to cut tax rate for consumers. PAN leader Marko Cortes said in a statement the VAT tax cut would only benefit “intermediaries,” and that it would fail to boost investment since it wa a presidential decree that could be removed at any moment.',\n",
       " 'Bahrain’s high court upheld on Monday a five-year jail sentence against human right activist Nabeel Rajab, his lawyer said, in a move described by campaign group a “political persecution” and “utterly outrageous”. An outspoken critic of the Bahraini government who played a prominent role in pro-democracy protest in 2011, Rajab wa convicted in February over social medium post in which he accused the prison authority of torture and criticised Saudi Arabia’s air strike in Yemen. Rajab, in his mid-50s, is already serving a two-year term for torture allegation he made in a news interview and face a number of other cases, including over a column he wrote in the New York Times in 2016. “The Court of Cassation rejected the appeal and upheld the sentence of five year in prison against Nabeel Rajab for his tweets,” his lawyer, Mohamed Al Jishi, told Reuters by telephone. Bahrain’s government communication office said in a statement to Reuters that Rajab wa afforded his full legal rights, including the right to appeal and continued access to legal counsel. “The Kingdom is fully committed to an inclusive pluralistic society, however, a in all countries, criminal offence cannot be allowed to go unchecked,” it added. Bahrain, where a Sunni Muslim royal family rule over a Shi’ite majority, clamped down on dissent after pro-democracy protest in 2011, led mainly by Shi’ites, were quashed with the help of Gulf Arab neighbours. Home to the U.S. Navy’s Fifth Fleet, the small Gulf island prosecuted hundred of protester in mass trial and banned the main opposition groups. Most of the leading Shi’ite opposition figure and human right activist are imprisoned or fled abroad. In July United Nations human right expert called on Bahrain to release detained activists, including Rajab, and said the authority had since last year undertaken “a fresh assault against freedom of expression, against civil society that is critical, and a marginalisation of political opposition parties.” Rajab lost an earlier appeal against the five-year sentence in June. A court filing by his lawyer showed he had been found guilty on charge of “spreading false news and rumour in time of war”, “insulting foreign countries” and “insulting publicly the interior ministry”. International right group have been following the case and the United States expressed concern. Lynn Maalouf Amnesty International’s Middle East Research Director said Rajab is a prisoner of conscience. “It is utterly outrageous that he ha already spent two year behind bar – including nine agonizing month in solitary confinement, amounting to torture,” she said in a statement released after the decision. Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, director of advocacy with the London-based Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy (BIRD), said the verdict wa a “political persecution.” Alwadaei accused the authority of timing of the verdict during the global holiday season to avoid drawing attention to the case.

       " 'The Vatican spokesman and his deputy resigned on Monday over disagreement on strategy, ending a year of upheaval in the Holy See’s communication structure. A brief Vatican statement gave no reason for the resignations. Spokesman Greg Burke, an American, tweeted that he and his Spanish deputy, Paloma Garcia Ovejero, had quit to let Pope Francis appoint a new team in what wa a “time of transition”. A Vatican source said both Burke and Ovejero had wanted more autonomy from the Vatican department that oversees all communications, known a the Dicastery for Communications. They quit two week after Pope Francis appointed a personal friend, Italian journalist Andrea Tornielli, to become editorial director of all Vatican communications. The source said it wa believed to be the first time both post had changed hand simultaneously, underscoring the difference of opinion. “Paloma and I have resigned, effective Jan. 1. At this time of transition in Vatican communications, we think it’s best the Holy Father is completely free to assemble a new team,” Burke tweeted. The 59-year-old former Rome-based reporter for Fox News joined the Vatican in 2012 a an advisor in it Secretariat of State and become spokesman in 2016. He is a member of the conservative Catholic group Opus Dei. Ovejero, 43, a former reporter for the Spanish radio network COPE, wa one of the few high-ranking woman in the Vatican. During Burke and Ovejero’s tenure, the top two job in the Vatican press room were, unusually, held by non-Italians. Tornielli is now the third-ranking person in the communication department but his closeness to the pope, whom he ha known since before the pontiff’s election in 2013, will likely make him particularly influential. Monday’s resignation capped a year of tension in Vatican communications. Monsignor Dario Vigano resigned a overall head in March after a scandal over a doctored letter, a public relation fiasco two month after the pope warned of the danger of fake news. Vigano released part of a letter by former Pope Benedict that wa to have remained private, using it to promote a book on the theology of Pope Francis. A promotional photo for the book released by Vigano blurred a part of the letter in which Benedict declined to write an introduction, saying he wa unhappy with one of it contributors.

       " 'Democratic Republic of Congo’s opposition said on Monday it expected one of it candidate to win the presidential election based on early vote tallies, but the ruling coalition said it wa confident it candidate had won the chaotic contest. The competing claim followed a disorderly election day on Sunday in which many Congolese were unable to vote due to an Ebola outbreak, conflict and logistical problems. After unofficial tally started to circulate on social medium on Monday, mobile internet connection in the capital Kinshasa and other city slowed down or cut out entirely, resident said, in a possible move by authority to stop the information from circulating. Government official could not be immediately reached for comment. Authorities have cut the internet in the past, saying they sought to stop rumour from spreading during protests. The vote is meant to choose a successor to President Joseph Kabila after 18 year in power and could lead to the vast central African country’s first ever democratic transition. But the opposition say the election wa marred by fraud and accused Kabila of planning to rule from the sideline through his preferred candidate. The government ha said the election wa fair. Any disputed outcome could lead to a repeat of the violence that followed the 2006 and 2011 election and a wider security breakdown, particularly along Congo’s border with Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi, where dozen of armed militia are active. Pierre Lumbi, the campaign manager to opposition candidate Martin Fayulu, said in a statement posted on Twitter that Fayulu wa winning after more than a third of vote had been counted. “The poll are clear: they put...Martin Fayulu easily in the lead,” he said. Vital Kamerhe, the campaign manager to another opposition candidate, Felix Tshisekedi, said earlier that initial counting showed Tshisekedi and Fayulu neck-and-neck in the lead, both with more than 40 percent of the vote. He said the ruling coalition candidate, Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, who is backed by Kabila, had only about 13 percent, although a significant part of the vote remained to be tabulated. Shadary’s campaign said he will win. “For us, victory is certain,” Nehemie Mwilanya, Kabila’s chief of staff and a member of Shadary’s campaign, told a news conference on Monday morning, without providing figures. Shadary’s campaign said it ha collected about 30 percent of the result but will not release any result before the national election commission (CENI). The election is a first-past-the-post system with no run-off. The first partial result are expected from CENI on Tuesday. Opposition official complained of widespread irregularities, including several instance of what they said wa outright fraud in Shadary’s favour. According to a Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, nearly half of polling place opened late, 30 percent encountered problem due to malfunctioning voting machine or absent voter roll and 10-15 percent were located in prohibited zone including police post and private residences. The most recent opinion poll before the election, released by New York University’s Congo Research Group on Friday, showed Fayulu, a former Exxon Mobil manager, leading the race on 47 percent. Tshisekedi had 24 percent and Shadary 19 percent. Election day wa mostly peaceful despite several violent incidents, including an altercation at a polling place in eastern Congo in which at least three people were killed. But the Catholic bishop conference (CENCO), which deployed thousand of vote monitors, said that many polling place opened late and were located in prohibited areas. CENI president Corneille Nangaa, however, said the vote had gone smoothly, aside from some minor difficulties, and the CENI rejected charge of fraud. More than 1.2 million Congolese in three opposition bastion were unable to vote at all after the CENI cancelled the poll there last week, citing an Ebola outbreak and ethnic violence. However, in the Ebola hotspot of Beni, an opposition stronghold, resident staged a mock presidential election to show the authority a decision to postpone the vote there due to health fear wa unfounded.

The party said Ashdown died on Saturday evening after a short illness. He had recently been hospitalised with bladder cancer. It said he would be remembered a someone who made an immeasurable contribution to furthering the cause of liberalism. Tributes came in from across the political spectrum. Prime Minister Theresa May said Ashdown served his country with distinction. “He dedicated his life to public service and he will be sorely missed,” she said in a statement.

Having stood down in 1999, he went on to become the United Nations high representative and European Union special representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina. Ashdown described himself a having few gift other than strong willpower. “People said I couldn’t learn Chinese, they said I couldn’t run 30 mile in six hours. This sound extraordinarily arrogant but I can’t remember a thing upon which I’ve set my mind that I didn’t succeed in doing,” he said in early 1992. He wa replaced a head of the party by Charles Kennedy who enjoyed further electoral success when he opposed Blair’s decision to invade Iraq, and the party under Nick Clegg entered power in a coalition David Cameron’s Conservatives in 2010.

Trump administration official say anyone working without pay will receive back pay once a deal is reached. Below is what will happen at some of the agency and department affected by the shutdown. The department that oversees Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Transportation Security Administration, the Coast Guard and the Secret Service is affected by the shutdown.

Though public housing authority and tribally designated housing entity are not part of the federal government and are not required to shut down, some of their funding is provided by the federal government, so they may need to reduce or change normal operating hours. The department, which is also responsible for some housing loan and low-income housing payments, said in it contingency plan a shutdown would likely not significantly affect the housing market. But, it added, “a protracted shutdown could see a decline in home sales, reversing the trend toward a strengthening market that we’ve been experiencing.” The National Park Service, under the umbrella of the Interior Department, will have a skeleton staff. Under it contingency plan, no national park will be open and no visitor service - including restrooms, facility maintenance and trash collection - will be provided.

A new election is not due until 2022 but one could be called if May fails to get her primary policy through parliament. Labour want a permanent custom union with the EU and a close relationship with it lucrative single market. The policy ha been dubbed “constructive ambiguity” by some, who question whether Labour could negotiate a better deal. Critics argue that Corbyn ha been happy to go along with the policy a long a the vote to leave the bloc is respected. He told the Guardian he still had concern about EU rule on state aid, and that he had to balance the view of all those in the party and understand why so many voted to leave the world’s biggest trading bloc. He said his plan for a custom union with the EU, to protect trade and access to the market, wa designed to do just that.',\n",
       " 'Turkey will take over the fight against Islamic State militant in Syria a the United States withdraws it troops, President Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday, in the latest upheaval wrought by Washington’s abrupt policy shift. The surprise announcement by U.S. President Donald Trump this week that he would withdraw roughly 2,000 troop ha felled a pillar of American policy in the Middle East. Critics say Trump’s decision will make it harder to find a diplomatic solution to Syria’s seven-year-old conflict. For Turkey, the step remove a source of friction with the United States. Erdogan ha long castigated his NATO ally over it support for Syrian Kurdish YPG fighter against Islamic State. Turkey considers the YPG a terrorist group and an offshoot of the armed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), fighting for Kurdish autonomy across the border on Turkish soil. In a speech in Istanbul, Erdogan said Turkey would mobilise to fight remaining Islamic State force in Syria and temporarily delay plan to attack Kurdish fighter in the northeast of Syria - shift both precipitated by the American decision to withdraw. The news wa le welcome for other U.S. allies. Both France and Germany warned that the U.S. change of course risked damaging the campaign against Islamic State, the jihadist who seized big swathe of Iraq and Syria in 2014-15 but have now been beaten back to a sliver of Syrian territory. Likewise, the U.S.-backed militia spearheaded by the YPG said a Turkish attack would force it to divert fighter from the battle against Islamic State to protect it territory. A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said American troop may continue to operate against Islamic State in Syria. The Pentagon is considering using Special Operation team based in Iraq to target militant in Syria, the official said. The official emphasized that using special operator on the ground wa one of many option being considered, wa still in the planning stage and that no final decision had been made. Islamic State launched an attack on Friday in Syria’s southeast against the U.S.-backed SDF militia, employing car bomb and dozen of militants. “We will be working on our operational plan to eliminate ISIS (Islamic State) elements, which are said to remain intact in Syria, in line with our conversation with President Trump,” Erdogan said. The Turkish president had announced plan last week to start an operation east of the Euphrates River in northern Syria to oust the YPG from the area that it largely controls. This week, he said the campaign could come at any moment. But on Friday, he cited the talk with Trump a a reason to wait. “Our phone call with President Trump, along with contact between our diplomat and security official and statement by the United States, have led u to wait a little longer,” he said. “We have postponed our military operation against the east of the Euphrates river until we see on the ground the result of America’s decision to withdraw from Syria.” Erdogan said, however, that this wa not an “open-ended waiting period” and that, due to past “negative experiences”, Ankara welcomed the United States’ statement with an equal amount of pleasure and caution. Turkey ha repeatedly voiced frustration over what it say is the slow implementation of a deal with Washington to pull YPG fighter out of Manbij, a town in mainly Arab territory west of the Euphrates in northern Syria. The United States will probably end it air campaign against IS in Syria when it pull out troops, U.S. official have said. Erdogan’s foreign minister said the withdrawal plan would be discussed by the two country in Washington in January. Trump maintained that IS had been wiped out, a view not shared by key allies, that Washington had been doing the work of other country and it wa “time for others to finally fight”. His defence secretary, Jim Mattis, opposed the decision and abruptly announced on Thursday he wa resigning after meeting with the president. In a candid letter to Trump, the retired Marine general emphasised the importance of “showing respect” to ally that have voiced surprise and concern about the president’s decision. Russia said on Friday it did not understand what the United States’ next step in Syria would be, adding that chaotic and unpredictable decision-making in Washington wa creating discomfort in international affairs. Several of Trump’s fellow Republicans in Congress, joined by opposition Democrats, urged the president to reverse course, saying the withdrawal would strengthen the hand of Russia and Iran in Syria and enable a resurgence of Islamic State. Trump ha given no sign of changing his mind. He promised to remove force from Syria during his 2016 election campaign. The roughly 2,000 U.S. troop in Syria, many of them special forces, were ostensibly helping to combat Islamic State but were also seen a a possible bulwark against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who ha retaken much of the country from his foe in the multi-sided civil war, with military help from Iran and Russia. IS declared a caliphate in 2014 after seizing part of Syria and Iraq. The ultra-hardline Sunni militant established their de facto capital in the Syrian city of Raqqa, using it a a base to plot attack in Europe. A senior U.S. official last week said Islamic State wa down to the last 1 percent of the territory it once held. The group ha no remaining territory in Iraq, though militant have resumed attack since their defeat there last year. Islamic State launched an attack on Friday on position held by the SDF in Syria’s southeast and the U.S.-led coalition mounted air strike in the area, an SDF official said. Kurdish-led force in northern Syria may not be able to continue to hold Islamic State prisoner if the situation in the region get out of control after a U.S. pullout, top Syrian Kurdish official Ilham Ahmed said on Friday.

       " 'Malaysia is seeking $7.5 billion in reparation from Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) over it dealing with scandal-linked state fund 1MDB, the Financial Times (FT) reported on Friday, citing the finance minister. Separately, Bloomberg reported that Singapore had expanded it criminal investigation of 1MDB to include Goldman Sachs, in a sign of increasing scrutiny of the bank’s role in the suspected multi-billion-dollar money laundering scheme. Malaysian prosecutor this week filed charge against Goldman Sachs in connection with it role a underwriter and arranger of three bond sale that raised $6.5 billion for 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), the first criminal action against the U.S. bank over the scandal. Goldman Sachs ha consistently denied wrongdoing and said certain member of the former Malaysian government and 1MDB lied to the bank about the proceeds of the bond sales. In addition to the bonds’ total value, Goldman Sachs should also return $1 billion to cover $600 million in fee paid to the bank and bond coupon that were “higher than the market rate”, the FT quoted Malaysian Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng a saying. Lim also told the FT that reparation should at least be more than $1.8 billion, the sum Goldman Sachs ha told investor it had set aside to cover potential loss related to 1MDB legal proceedings. “Their figure is $1.8 billion. Ours is $7.5 billion,” Lim said. Malaysia is not currently negotiating with Goldman, but charge filed on Monday could bring the bank to the table, Lim said. In an emailed response to Reuters, a Goldman Sachs spokesman said the bank intended to “vigorously contest these charges”. “The 1MDB bond offering were meant to raise money to benefit Malaysia; instead, a huge portion of those fund were stolen for the benefit of member of the Malaysian government and their associates,” the spokesman said. “Certain member of that government and 1MDB lied to Goldman about the use of proceeds from these transactions.” Critics have said the fee earned by Goldman Sachs were far in excess of the normal 1-2 percent a bank could expect for helping sell bonds. Goldman ha said the outsized fee related to additional risks: it bought the unrated bond while it sought investor and, in the case of a 2013 bond deal which raised $2.7 billion, 1MDB wanted the fund quickly. Malaysia ha sought jail term and billion in fine from Goldman Sachs and four individual who allegedly misappropriated about $2.7 billion from the 1MDB bond proceeds. The U.S. Department of Justice alleges that a total of about $4.5 billion wa misappropriated from 1MDB and used to buy, among others, real estate in London and New York, expensive jewellery and artwork, and a private jet. Bloomberg, citing unidentified sources, reported that Singapore ha expanded a criminal investigation into fund flow linked to 1MDB to include Goldman Sachs. Authorities in Singapore were trying to determine whether some of the $600 million in fee that Goldman earned from the three bond deal flowed to the Singapore subsidiary, the news agency said. In response to the report, the Singapore police said their criminal investigation into entity involved in 1MDB-related offence in Singapore had been going on since 2015. They did not comment further. A spokesman for Goldman Sachs said in a statement: “The firm continues to cooperate with all authority investigating this matter.” Goldman Sachs (Singapore) PTE wa one of the three unit charged by Malaysia this week. Shares of the U.S. investment bank fell to a two-year low this week after Malaysia filed the charges. Two former Goldman Sachs bankers, Tim Leissner and Roger Ng, have been charged by Malaysia and the U.S. Department of Justice. Singapore ha banned Leissner, the bank’s former Southeast Asia chairman, from it security industry for life after he pleaded guilty in the United States for conspiring to launder 1MDB money and violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The United States is also seeking extradition of Ng, who ha been detained in Malaysia.',\n",
       " 'An Israeli court sentenced a Palestinian to 18 year imprisonment on Monday for stabbing to death a British woman in Jerusalem last year, under a plea bargain acknowledging he is mentally ill. Jamil Tamimi, 59, killed 21-year-old exchange student Hannah Bladon on a tram a she wa going to the church where she volunteered, the court heard. He targeted her at random when she came within his reach after offering her seat to an older woman, stabbing her at least seven times. “This wa not a terrorist incident ... This wa a terrible murder carried out by a mentally ill person,” the prosecutor said, explaining why a life prison sentence had not been sought, according to a court transcript. Tamimi’s lawyer said the defendant attacked Bladon in a rage at his son insisting that he stay in a mental institution rather than with them. “This drove him to stab a person to death so that he would be shot dead,” the lawyer said. In the April 14, 2017 incident, Tamimi wa overpowered and arrested. Dozens of Palestinians who carried out similar attacks, many of them a a political act against Israel, have been shot by security force or armed civilians. Bladon’s relative said the sentence wa too lenient. “For the family, it make no difference whether this wa a terror attack or just another crazed murderer,” the family’s representative, Israeli lawyer Maurice Hirsch, told Reuters. “They are outraged by the leniency of the sentence. They expected that Hannah’s murderer would spent the rest of his life behind bars.” The court transcript quoted Tamimi a saying after sentencing: “I’m sorry. I wish I could take her (Bladon’s) place. I did not mean to murder her. I don’t know how it happened.” Writing by Dan Williams; Editing by Jeffrey Heller and Robin Pomeroy All quote delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
